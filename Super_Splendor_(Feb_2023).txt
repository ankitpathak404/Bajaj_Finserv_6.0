You will find many \nhelpful  recommendations  through  out  this \nmanual. Following are a few that we consider \nmost important.\nAlways wear a helmet\nIt is a proven fact, helmet significantly reduces \nthe number and severity of head injuries. So \nalways  wear  a  helmet  and  make  sure  your \npillion  rider  does  the  same.  We  also \nrecommend  that  you  wear  eye  protection, \nsturdy boots, gloves and other protective gear.\nBefore riding your vehicle\nMake sure that you are physically fit, mentally \nfocused and free of alcohol and drugs. Check \nthat you and your pillion are both wearing an \napproved  vehicle  helmet  and  protective \napparel. Instruct your pillion on holding onto \nthe grab rail or your waist, leaning with you in \nturns, and keeping their feet on the footrest, \neven when the vehicle is stopped.\nTake  time  to  learn  &  practice  your \nvehicle\nEven  if  you  have  ridden  other  vehicles, \npractice  riding  in  a  safe  area  to  become \nfamiliar  with  how  this  vehicle  works  and \nhandles, and to become accustomed to the \nvehicle's size and weight.", 'Ride defensively\nAlways  pay  due  attention  to  other  vehicles \naround  you,  and  do  not  assume  that  other \ndrivers see you. Be prepared to stop quickly or \nperform an evasive maneuver.\nMake yourself easily visible\nSome drivers do not see vehicles because they \nare not looking for them. To make yourself more \nvisible, wear bright reflective clothing, position \nyourself so that others can see you, signal before \nturning or changing lanes, and use horn which \nwill help others to notice you.\nRide within your limits\nPushing the limits is another major cause of \nvehicle  accidents.  Never  ride  beyond  your \npersonal  abilities  or  faster  than  conditions \ndemand.  Remember  that  fatigue  and \nnegligence can significantly reduce your ability \nto make good judgements and ride safely.\nDo not drink and ride\nRiding under the influence of alcohol or drugs \nis dangerous. Alcohol can reduce your ability \nto respond to changing conditions and reduce \nthe reaction time. Do not drink and ride. \nKeep your vehicle in safe condition\nFor safe riding, its important to inspect your \nvehicle  before  every  ride  and  perform  all \nrecommended  maintenance.  Never  exceed \nload limits, and use accessories that have been \nrecommended  by  Hero  MotoCorp  for  this \nvehicle. \n8', 'If you are involved in a crash\nPersonal safety is your first priority. If you or \nanyone else has been injured, take time to \nassess the severity of the injuries and whether \nit is safe to continue riding. Call for emergency \nassistance  if  needed.  Also  follow  applicable \nlaws  and  regulations  if  another  person  or \nvehicle is involved in the crash.\nIf you decide to continue riding, first evaluate \nthe condition of your vehicle. If the engine is \nstill running, turn it off. Inspect for fluid leaks, \ncheck the tightness of critical nuts and bolts, \nand check the handlebar, brake levers, brakes, \nand wheels. Ride slowly and cautiously. Your \nvehicle may have suffered damage that is not \nimmediately  apparent.  Have  your  vehicle \nthoroughly  checked  at  a  qualified  service \nfacility as soon as possible.\nPROTECTIVE APPAREL\nFor your safety, we strongly recommend that \nyou  always  wear  an  approved  helmet  (ISI \nmarked), eye protection, boots, gloves, long \npants  and  a  long  sleeve  shirt  or  jacket \nwhenever  you  ride.  Take  care  of  loose/ \nhanging  clothes  while  solo/pillion  riding. \nAlthough complete protection is not possible, \nwearing proper gear can reduce the chance of \ninjury when you ride. \nFollowing are suggestions to help you choose \nproper riding  gear. \n\nWARNING\n\n!!', 'WARNING\n\n!!\n\n• Not wearing a helmet increases the chance of \nserious injury or death in a crash. \n• Be sure you and your pillion always wear a \nhelmet, eye protection and other protective \napparel when you ride.\nHelmets and eye protection\nYour helmet is your most important piece of \nriding  gear  because  it  offers  the  best \nprotection  against  head  injuries.  A  helmet \nshould fit your head comfortably and securely. \nA bright coloured helmet can make you more \nnoticeable in traffic, as can reflective strips.\nAn open-face helmet offers some protection, \nbut  a  full-face  helmet  offers  more.  Always \nwear face shield or goggles to protect your \neyes and help your vision.\nAdditional riding gear\nIn addition to a helmet and eye protection, we \nalso recommend:\n• Sturdy  boots  with  non-slip  soles  to  help \nprotect your feet and ankles.\n• Leather gloves to keep your hands warm \nand help prevent blisters, cuts, burns, and \nbruises.\n• A  two  wheeler  riding  suit  or  jacket  for \ncomfort  as  well  as  protection.  Bright \ncoloured reflective clothing can help make \nyou more noticeable in traffic. Be sure to \navoid loose clothes that could get caught on \nany part of your vehicle. \n\n9', "9\n\n \n\x0cDon't\n• Never  use  cell  phone  while  riding  the      \nvehicle.\n• Avoid  sudden  acceleration,  braking  and \nturning of your  vehicle.\n• Never shift gears without disengaging the \nclutch and closing the throttle.\n• Never touch any part of the hot exhaust      \nsystem like muffler.\n• Never ride under the influence of alcohol or \ndrugs.\n• Concentrate on the road and avoid talking \nto the pillion rider or others on the road.\n• Do not litter the road.\n• Do not cross the continuous white/yellow \nline  in  the  center  of  the  road,  while \novertaking.\n• Do not attach large or heavy items to the      \nhandlebars, front forks, or fenders.\n• Never  take  your  hands  off  the  steering \nhandle while riding.\n• Do  not  move  the  side  stand  down  while \nriding, as engine will stop while vehicle is in \ngear (page 23) (Wheel locking leading to \naccident, part damage etc.).\n\nSAFE RIDING TIPS", "SAFE RIDING TIPS\n\nDo's:\n• Always conduct simple pre-ride inspection \n(page 28).\n• Always  wear  a  helmet  (ISI  marked)  with \nchin strap securely fastened and insist on a \nhelmet for your pillion rider.\n• While riding, sit in a comfortable position \nwith your legs close to fuel tank.\n• Ride  defensively  and  at  a  steady  speed \n(between 40-50 km/hr).\n• To stop the vehicle (in IBS), press the rear \nbrake pedal for the application of front and \nrear  brakes  simultaneously.  However,  for \nmore  effective  braking,  use  both  brakes \nsimultaneously,  keeping  throttle  in  the \nclosed position.\n• Respect road signs and obey traffic rules for \nyour own safety and that of others on the \nroad (page 71).\n• During night time, dip headlamps of your \nvehicle  for  oncoming  traffic,  or  when \nfollowing another vehicle.\n• Give way to others on the road and signal \nbefore you make a turn.\n• To make yourself more visible, wear bright \nreflective clothing that fits well.\n• Tightly wrap loose/hanging clothes & avoid \nentangling with moving parts.\n• Get your vehicle serviced regularly by the \nAuthorised Hero MotoCorp workshop.\n• Before riding make sure in which mode you \nare riding whether with i3s switch “ON” or \n“OFF”.\n\n10\n\n\x0cTIPS FOR HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT\nThe following tips shall ensure a healthy vehicle, healthy environment, and a healthy you.\n\n• Healthy engine: The engine is the lifeline of every vehicle.

The \ncatalytic converter acts on HC, CO and NOx.\nThe catalytic converter must operate at a high \ntemperature for the chemical reactions to take \nplace.  It  can  set  on  fire  any  combustible \nmaterial that come near it. Park your vehicle \naway from high grasses, dry leaves, or other \nflammable material.\nA defective catalytic converter contributes to \nair  pollution  and  can  impair  your  engine’s \nperformance.\nFollow  these  guidelines  to  protect  your \nvehicle’s catalytic converter.\n• Always use unleaded petrol. Even a small \namount of leaded petrol can contaminate \nthe  catalyst  metals,  making  the  catalytic \nconverter ineffective.\n• Keep the engine in good running condition. \nA  poorly  running  engine  can  cause  the \ncatalytic converter to overheat.\n• If  your  engine  is  misfiring,  backfiring, \nstalling, or otherwise not running properly, \nstop riding and turn “OFF” the engine.

During warm weather, the petrol\nvapours which contain HC evaporates easily \ninto the atmosphere from the fuel tank, if the \nfuel  system  is  unsealed  or  open.  The \nevaporative emission control system is used to \nprevent petrol vapours from escaping into the \natmosphere from fuel tank. The canister (1) \ncollects the fuel vapour from the fuel tank and \nthen the fuel vapour is drawn into the engine \nfor re-burning to avoid pollution caused by the \nfuel vapour diffused into the air.\n\n(1) Canister\nPOLISHING OF VEHICLE\nAfter washing your vehicle, wax all painted \nsurfaces (except matte painted surfaces) using \na commercially available polish/quality liquid \nor paste wax to finish the job.
