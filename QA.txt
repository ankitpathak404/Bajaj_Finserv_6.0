When requesting pre-authorization for an air ambulance transfer following a road accident, the process for re-issuing a lost policy document and the waiting period for new dependents included in the policy this year are not explicitly addressed in the provided context, as the context primarily focuses on claim assessment, submission, and settlement procedures, such as the requirement for "pre-authorisation" for certain treatments and the need to submit claim forms and accompanying documents, including "original bills" and "medical records," to the TPA Head Office, but it does mention that "any change" to the policy, which could potentially include adding new dependents or re-issuing documents, "will be evidenced by a written endorsement signed and stamped by Us," implying that any modifications or requests related to the policy, including those for lost documents or dependent additions, would need to be formally approved and documented by the insurance company.

person is eligible to claim under the Policy and after satisfying itself will issue a pre- 
authorization letter / guarantee of payment letter to the Hospital / Nursing Home mentioning 
the sum guaranteed as payable, also the ailment for which the person is seeking to be 
admitted as an in-patient. The Company / TPA reserves the right to deny pre-authorization 
in case the Hospital / Insured Person is unable to provide the relevant information/medical 
details as required by the Company/ TPA. In such circumstances denial of Cashless Access 
should in no way be construed as denial of liability. The Insured Person may obtain the

/ insured.

j.  Change of Policyholder

üß† Refined Answer:
The policy does not explicitly cover cosmetic surgery, as it only undertakes to pay for expenses incurred on "medically necessary treatment" that is "reasonable and customary" for the treatment of a "DISEASE" or "INJURY" as defined in the policy, and there is no mention of cosmetic surgery as a covered benefit, implying that such procedures would not be eligible for insurance coverage under this policy unless they are deemed medically necessary and meet the specified conditions.
