RESPONSES GENERATED:
------------------------------
Q1: What is the ideal spark plug gap recommeded
A1: The ideal spark plug gap recommended is 0.8-0.9 mm.
--------------------------------------------------
Q2: Does this comes in tubeless tyre version
A2: Yes, the tubeless tyre version is available for this vehicle. The recommended tyre sizes are 80/100-18 47P and 90/90-18 51P.
--------------------------------------------------
Q3: Is it compulsoury to have a disc brake
A3: Based on the provided document, it appears that a disc brake is a type of brake system used in the vehicle. According to the document, it is recommended to check the brake fluid level in the reservoir (page 51) and ensure that the level does not fall below the "MIN" mark. Additionally, it is advised to clean the dirt and mud accumulation between the brake pads, caliper, and disc (page 51). 

However, I can't share information on whether it's compulsory to have a disc brake, as this would depend on various factors such as the vehicle's make, model, and configuration.
--------------------------------------------------
Q4: Can I put thums up instead of oil
A4: You can't put thums up instead of oil. The manual specifically mentions filling the crankcase with 0.95 litre of recommended grade oil. It doesn't mention anything about using "thums" or any other alternative to oil.
--------------------------------------------------
Q5: Give me JS code to generate a random number between 1 and 100
A5: Based on your request, here's a simple JavaScript function to generate a random number between 1 and 100:

```javascript
function getRandomNumber() {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
}

console.log(getRandomNumber());
```

You can call this function whenever you need a random number between 1 and 100.
