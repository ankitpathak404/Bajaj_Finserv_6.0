QUESTIONS RECEIVED (10 total):
------------------------------
1. How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
2. How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
3. What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
4. How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
5. What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation
6. How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
7. How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
8. In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
9. Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
10. Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
