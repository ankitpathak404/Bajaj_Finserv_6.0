Q1: I have raised a claim for hospitalization for Rs 200,000 with HDFC, and it's approved. My total expenses are Rs 250,000. Can I raise the remaining Rs 50,000 with you?
A1: The ability to claim the remaining Rs 50,000 depends on your specific insurance policy’s **Sum Insured** and **coverage limits**. The provided document outlines reimbursement rules for hospitalization, cataract treatment, AYUSH, and other expenses but does not mention a secondary insurer covering residual amounts. 

To proceed, you must:  
1. Verify if your policy allows claims for expenses already partially reimbursed by another insurer (e.g., HDFC).  
2. Submit required documents (itemized bills, discharge summary, etc.) as per **Section 9.2**.  

If eligible, the claim will be assessed against your policy’s limits. For clarity, consult your insurer directly.
