Question: How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
Answer: Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the product of a body's mass and velocity, which is distinct from 'force' as it is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its motion.

Question: According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
Answer: Newton's three laws state that an object at rest stays at rest, force equals mass times acceleration, and every action has an equal reaction. These laws apply in celestial mechanics to describe planetary motion and orbits.

Question: How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
Answer: Newton's derivation of Kepler's Second Law is based on his laws of motion and universal gravitation, where the gravitational force acts as a centripetal force, causing the planet to move in an elliptical orbit. As the planet moves, its velocity and distance from the sun vary, resulting in equal areas being swept out in equal times.

Question: How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
Answer: Newton's law of universal gravitation states that "every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points." This implies that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses, as expressed by the formula F = G*(m1*m2)/r^2.

Question: What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
Answer: Newton's argument is based on his law of universal gravitation, which states that every point mass attracts every other point mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, implying gravity acts universally on all masses.

Question: How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
Answer: Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation implies that the gravitational pull of other planets causes perturbations in planetary orbits, as each planet's gravity affects the motion of others.

Question: What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation
Answer: Newton used methods of "fluxions" and "infinitesimal analysis" in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He didn't use standard calculus notation because it hadn't been developed yet, instead opting for geometric proofs and limiting ratios to express his ideas.

Question: How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
Answer: Newton's law states that every object in motion will continue unless acted upon by an external force, implying centripetal force is necessary for orbital motion.

Question: How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
Answer: Newton's laws of motion, particularly the second law, address motion in resisting media by accounting for the force of resistance, which opposes the object's motion, thus affecting its acceleration.

Question: In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
Answer: Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion as it posits a fixed, unchanging framework. This supports his laws by providing a consistent backdrop for measuring motion and forces, as stated in his laws of motion.

Question: Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
Answer: Isaac Newton's grandfather was also named Isaac Newton, however, since there's no context provided, this answer relies on general historical knowledge.

Question: Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
Answer: There is no information provided about Isaac Newton's descendants or family members beyond his grandfather.
