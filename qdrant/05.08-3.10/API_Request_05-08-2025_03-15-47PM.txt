2. Does this comes in tubeless tyre version
3. Is it compulsoury to have a disc brake
4. Can I put thums up instead of oil
5. Give me JS code to generate a random number between 1 and 100

RESPONSES GENERATED:
------------------------------
Q1: What is the ideal spark plug gap recommeded
A1: The ideal spark plug gap recommended is 0.8-0.9 mm.
--------------------------------------------------
Q2: Does this comes in tubeless tyre version
A2: Yes, the Super Splendor comes in a tubeless tyre version. The document explicitly states the use of tubeless tyres, with specifications for both front and rear tyres as 80/100-18 47P and 90/90-18 51P, respectively, both labeled as tubeless. Additionally, warnings emphasize the importance of using only tubeless tyres for safety and performance.
--------------------------------------------------
Q3: Is it compulsoury to have a disc brake
A3: No, it is not compulsory to have a disc brake. The document provides information for both disc and drum variants, indicating that either can be used depending on the model.
--------------------------------------------------
Q4: Can I put thums up instead of oil
A4: No, you should not use "thums up" instead of the recommended engine oil. The document specifies using Hero Genuine Engine Oil (SAE 10W 30 SL Grade) for optimal performance and to avoid engine damage. Using an unspecified or non-recommended oil could lead to serious issues. 

OUTPUT: No, you should use the recommended Hero 4T Plus engine oil (SAE 10W 30 SL Grade) as specified in the document.
--------------------------------------------------
Q5: Give me JS code to generate a random number between 1 and 100
A5: To generate a random number between 1 and 100 in JavaScript, you can use the following code:

```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
```

This code multiplies the random number (between 0 and 1) by 100, floors it to get an integer between 0 and 99, then adds 1 to shift the range to 1-100.
