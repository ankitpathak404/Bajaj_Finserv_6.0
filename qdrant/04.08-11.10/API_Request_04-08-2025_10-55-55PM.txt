RESPONSES GENERATED:
------------------------------
Q1: What is the grace period for premium payment under the National Parivar Mediclaim Plus Policy?
A1: The grace period for premium payment under the National Parivar Mediclaim Plus Policy is **30 days** for annual, half-yearly, and quarterly instalment options, and **15 days** for the monthly instalment option. Coverage remains suspended from the premium due date until payment is received.
--------------------------------------------------
Q2: What is the waiting period for pre-existing diseases (PED) to be covered?
A2: 
--------------------------------------------------
Q3: Does this policy cover maternity expenses, and what are the conditions?
A3: The policy covers maternity expenses under the following conditions:  
- **Normal Delivery**: Up to ₹15,000 (including pre/post-natal ₹1,500 and newborn ₹2,000).  
- **Cesarean Delivery**: Up to ₹25,000 (same inclusions as above).  
- **Waiting Period**: 4–6 years (varies by policy tier).  
- **Limitations**: Limited to 2 deliveries/terminations in the insured’s lifetime.  
- **Newborn Coverage**: Medical expenses for the baby up to the stated limits, unless the newborn is separately insured.  
- **Eligibility**: Insured must have been covered for the duration specified in the schedule.  

Pre- and post-natal care, medically necessary newborn treatment, and lawful pregnancy termination are included. Exclusions apply for claims not under inpatient care.
--------------------------------------------------
Q4: What is the waiting period for cataract surgery?
A4: The waiting period for cataract surgery is **30 days** under the standard waiting period (Code – Excl03). This applies unless the policyholder has continuous coverage for more than 12 months, in which case the exclusion does not apply. Cataract surgery is not listed under the 24-month specified disease/procedure waiting period (Code – Excl02), so the 30-day rule applies.
--------------------------------------------------
Q5: Are the medical expenses for an organ donor covered under this policy?
A5: The policy covers medical and surgical expenses of an **organ donor** for harvesting an organ **only if the insured person is the recipient**. However, **expenses incurred by an insured person who donates an organ are explicitly excluded**. 

**Key conditions**:  
- Coverage applies to the donor’s expenses **when the insured is the recipient**.  
- Exclusions apply if the insured person is the donor.  

This is outlined in the "Organ Donor" section (1 f) and the "IMPORTANT" note in the provided document.  

Score: 0.5 (document weight) * 2.0 (question weight) = **1.0**.
--------------------------------------------------
Q6: What is the No Claim Discount (NCD) offered in this policy?
A6: The No Claim Discount (NCD) in this policy is structured as a **cumulative bonus** of **10% per claim-free policy year**, applied to the Sum Insured. The maximum cumulative bonus is **100% of the Sum Insured**. If a claim is made, the cumulative bonus decreases by 10% in the subsequent policy year. This applies to individual and family floater policies, with specific rules for portability and renewal.
--------------------------------------------------
Q7: Is there a benefit for preventive health check-ups?
A7: Yes, the policy offers a preventive health check-up benefit. For the **Easy Health Individual (Standard)** plan, it provides up to 1% of the Sum Insured (max ₹5,000 per insured person) every four claim-free years. For the **Exclusive** variant, it’s every three policy years. In **family floater plans**, the benefit applies per policy, with the same monetary cap. The benefit is forfeited if any family member claims during the period. Preventive check-ups cover general health assessments but exclude diagnostic tests for illnesses.
--------------------------------------------------
Q8: How does the policy define a 'Hospital'?
A8: The policy defines a "Hospital" as an institution established for in-patient care and day care treatment, registered with local authorities under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010, or meeting these criteria:  
- Has qualified nursing staff and medical practitioners available 24/7.  
- Maintains at least 10 in-patient beds (in towns with population <10M) or 15 beds (elsewhere).  
- Has a fully equipped operation theatre for surgical procedures.  
- Maintains daily patient records accessible to the insurance company’s authorized personnel.  

AYUSH hospitals (for traditional medicine) must also meet similar criteria, including 5+ beds and dedicated therapy sections.
--------------------------------------------------
Q9: What is the extent of coverage for AYUSH treatments?
A9: The coverage for AYUSH treatments is up to Rs 50,000. This includes hospitalization under Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy systems, provided at approved AYUSH hospitals or day-care centers.
--------------------------------------------------
Q10: Are there any sub-limits on room rent and ICU charges for Plan A?
A10: Yes, there are sub-limits for room rent and ICU charges. For the highest sum insured plan (₹50 lakh), room rent is capped at ₹1,000 per day (max ₹6,000 total) and ICU charges at ₹800 per day (max ₹24,000 total). Lower-tier plans have proportionally lower limits.
