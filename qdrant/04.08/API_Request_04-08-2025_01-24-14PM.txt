Q8: When making a cashless psychiatric care request for a dependent child at “Harmony Wellness,” at the same time, seek the critical illness survival benefit details and the list of required claim documents for a cancer diagnosis.
A8: To make a cashless psychiatric care request for a dependent child at "Harmony Wellness," you'll need to follow the policy's procedure for availing cashless access services in a network hospital/nursing home. 

First, ensure that Harmony Wellness is a network hospital, which can be checked on the official Oriental Insurance website (www.orientalinsurance.org.in). 

Next, submit a request for cashless admission, providing the required medical details and information. The company/TPA will verify your eligibility and issue a pre-authorization letter or guarantee of payment to the hospital.

Regarding the critical illness survival benefit details for cancer diagnosis, the policy covers cancer of specified severity, which is a malignant tumor characterized by uncontrolled growth of malignant cells. This diagnosis must be supported by histological evidence of malignancy and confirmed by a pathologist.

As for the list of required claim documents for a cancer diagnosis, the policy doesn't explicitly mention a specific list. However, it's likely that you'll need to provide medical records, test results, and other relevant documents to support your claim.

To proceed with your claim, I recommend contacting the Oriental Insurance company or your TPA directly for guidance and assistance.

--------------------------------------------------
Q10: When pursuing claim settlement for a dependent's cataract surgery and simultaneously seeking to upgrade from Silver to Diamond plan with enhanced sum insured, also request the regional ombudsman contact for your state.
