Q1: How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1: Newton defines “quantity of motion” (what we now call momentum) as the measure that arises from a body’s **quantity of matter (its mass) together with its velocity**. In his own words (Definition II): “The quantity of motion is the measure of the same, arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly.” Thus a body twice as massive with the same speed has twice the quantity of motion; a body moving twice as fast has four‑times the quantity of motion.

“Force,” by contrast, is not a property of the moving body but the **cause that changes that quantity of motion**. Newton distinguishes several kinds of force (absolute, accelerative, motive) and states (Law II) that “the alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed.” In other words, force is the agent that produces or modifies the quantity of motion, whereas the quantity of motion itself is the product of mass and velocity.
--------------------------------------------------
Q2: How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A2: Newton derives Kepler’s second law by applying his second law of motion to a body that is acted on only by a **central (centripetal) force**.  

1. **Law II (F = ma)** tells us that the force on a body is proportional to its acceleration.  
2. **Corollary VI** (and the accompanying scholium) shows that when the force is always directed toward the centre of motion it has two components:  
   * a component **along the radius** (which changes the speed of the body), and  
   * a component **perpendicular to the radius** (which only changes the direction of the velocity).  

3. Because the force is **central**, the perpendicular component produces no torque about the centre; therefore the **angular momentum** of the body about the centre is constant.  

4. Constant angular momentum means that the **areal velocity** (the area swept out by the radius vector per unit time) is constant:  

\[
\frac{dA}{dt}= \frac{1}{2} r^{2}\,\dot\theta = \text{constant}
\]

5. Since the areal velocity is constant, the radius vector sweeps **equal areas in equal times**.  

Thus, from his laws of motion and the fact that the gravitational force is a central force, Newton proves that any body moving under gravity (or any central force) describes equal areas in equal times—exactly Kepler’s second law.
--------------------------------------------------
Q3: How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A3: Newton shows the inverse‑square law by treating each body as a collection of infinitesimal parts whose individual attractions obey the reciprocal‑square law, then proving that the sum of all those partial attractions also obeys the same law.  

1. **Decomposition into parts** – He first notes that the gravitational force exerted by a whole planet on a body is the compound of the forces exerted by each of its constituent parts, and that each partial force is “reciprocally proportional to the squares of the distances from the part” (Prop. VIII, Theorem VIII).  

2. **Summation of the partial forces** – Using Propositions LXXV and LXXVI (and their corollaries) he shows that when all these partial forces are summed, the resulting total force retains the same proportionality: the total force on a sphere is proportional to the product of the masses and **inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two centres**.  

3. **Common centre of gravity** – He then argues that the mutual attraction of two bodies can be regarded as if each were attracted toward the common centre of gravity (the midpoint for equal masses). Since the law of attraction is the same with respect to the distance between the bodies and the distance to the common centre, the same inverse‑square dependence holds for the mutual force.  

Thus, by decomposing the bodies, summing the inverse‑square contributions of all parts, and invoking the symmetry of the common centre of gravity, Newton demonstrates that the gravitational attraction between two masses varies **inversely as the square of the distance between their centres**.
--------------------------------------------------
Q4: What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A4: Newton argues that gravity must act on all masses because the gravitational force is proportional to the quantity of matter in a body, and every part of a body attracts every other part. By the law of action‑and‑reaction, each part of one body exerts a force on each part of another, so the total force between two bodies is the sum of the forces between all their parts. Since the force on each part is proportional to its mass and follows the same inverse‑square law, the resulting attraction is universal: every mass, however small, both produces and experiences the same gravitational force, the only difference being that the force on tiny bodies is so small that it is not perceptible. This reasoning shows that gravitational attraction is a universal, mass‑proportional, inverse‑square force that acts on all masses.
--------------------------------------------------
Q5: How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A5: Newton explains that the orbits of the planets are not perfect ellipses because each planet is also attracted by the other planets.  The mutual gravitational attractions act in different directions and with different strengths, so the accelerative force on any one planet is not exactly the same as on the others.  When the forces are unequal (i.e., when the attractions are not exactly proportional to the inverse‑square of the distances or when the masses and distances differ), the resulting “difference of the forces” produces a perturbation of the orbit.  This perturbation appears as a change in longitude (a shift along the orbit) and also as a change in latitude (a tilt out of the orbital plane).  The magnitude of the perturbation is proportional to the magnitude of the disturbing force—e.g., the difference between the Sun’s and Jupiter’s attractions on Saturn, or the influence of Jupiter and Saturn on each other—so the larger the masses and the closer the distances, the larger the perturbation.  For the inner planets the perturbations are very small because their masses are small, while the perturbations of the larger outer planets (especially Jupiter and Saturn) are more noticeable.  In short, Newton attributes planetary perturbations to the unequal, non‑parallel gravitational forces that the planets exert on one another, which modify the ideal elliptical motion.
--------------------------------------------------
Q6: What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation
A6: Newton’s “Principia” was built on the same ideas that later became calculus, but he expressed them in the geometric language of his time.  In the work he used:

* **Fluxions and fluents** – the quantities Newton called “fluxions” (the instantaneous rates of change) and the “fluents” (the quantities that flow).  He derived them by treating curves, surfaces and solids as being generated by the continuous motion of points, lines and surfaces, and he obtained their velocities by the rules of infinite series.  This is essentially the differential‑integral method that later became calculus.

* **Geometric synthesis** – Newton preferred to develop the results by pure geometry (the “geometrical method”) rather than by algebraic manipulation, following his own conviction that the geometric method was the proper way to train the mind.

* **Binomial theorem and infinite series** – he applied his binomial theorem and infinite‑series expansions to the rectification of curves, the determination of areas, volumes and centres of gravity, which are the analytic tools that underlie integral calculus.

Newton did not use the modern “calculus notation” (the “d‑notation” of Leibniz, the dot‑notation for derivatives, etc.) for two reasons given in the text:

1. **Preference for the geometric method** – Newton believed that geometry was the proper vehicle for developing mathematical thought and that algebraic calculations were a “censured” handling of geometric subjects.  His authority and taste led him to present his results in a purely geometric form.

2. **Notation had not yet been published** – the algorithmic notation for fluxions did not appear until it was printed in Wallis’s work in 1693, well after the “Principia” was completed.  Consequently, Newton’s work remained in the geometric‑fluxion language rather than the later standard calculus symbols.
--------------------------------------------------
Q7: How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A7: Newton explains orbital motion by asserting that any body that moves in a curved path is continually acted on by a **centripetal force** directed toward a fixed centre of force. This inward‑directed force supplies the acceleration needed to keep the body from moving in a straight line and to keep it on its orbit. In the case of a circular orbit the centripetal force is exactly the gravitational attraction of the central body, and its magnitude is proportional to the square of the body’s velocity and inversely proportional to the radius of the orbit (or, equivalently, proportional to the square of the distance from the centre when expressed as a force law). Newton shows that, because the centripetal force is the same at equal distances from the centre, the velocities of bodies at equal altitudes are equal, and the acceleration produced by the centripetal force is the same for bodies moving along adjacent circular arcs. By relating the centripetal force to the known force of gravity (through the descent of heavy bodies and the law of periods), Newton demonstrates that the gravitational force of the Earth (or any central body) is the centripetal force that keeps moons, planets, and other bodies in their orbital motions.
--------------------------------------------------
Q8: How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A8: Newton treats a resisting medium by adding a resistive force to the ordinary equations of motion. In his analysis the resistance of a fluid is split into three parts:  

* a part that depends on the **density** of the fluid and is proportional to the **square of the velocity** (a “duplicate‑ratio” of the velocity);  
* a part that depends on the **tenacity (viscous tenacity)** of the fluid and is **uniform** (or proportional to the “moment of time”);  
* a part that is proportional to the **velocity itself** (the “ratio of the velocity”).  

In the propositions of Book II Newton shows that the motion of a body in such a medium can be treated by adding this resistance to the body’s weight when the body moves upward (so the net force is gravity + uniform resistance) and subtracting it when the body moves downward (gravity – uniform resistance). The same method can be extended to cases where the resistance is partly uniform, partly proportional to the velocity, and partly proportional to the square of the velocity, as indicated in the Scholium and the corollaries to Propositions VIII, IX, XIII and XIV. Thus Newton handles motion in resisting media by incorporating appropriate resistance terms (uniform, linear, and quadratic) into the force balance governing the body's motion.
--------------------------------------------------
Q9: In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A9: Newton treats **time and space as “absolute”** – they exist in their own nature, unaltered by anything external.  Absolute time (duration) flows uniformly, and absolute space is a fixed, immovable framework.  **Relative motion** is only the change of position measured with respect to other bodies or to a “movable” reference; it is an apparent, sensible measure that can change without any force acting on the body itself.

In Newton’s view **absolute motion** is the translation of a body from one absolute place to another, and it is detectable by the **real forces** it produces (e.g., the centrifugal forces that appear only in true circular motion).  By contrast, **relative motion** can be altered simply by moving the reference body; it need not involve any force on the object whose motion is being described.

This distinction underpins Newton’s laws:

* **Law I (inertia)** and **Law II (force = mass × acceleration)** are formulated with respect to the immutable absolute space and time; only in this fixed frame does a body’s change of motion (acceleration) correspond uniquely to the forces impressed on it.  
* Because absolute space provides an immutable reference, the **effects that distinguish absolute from relative motion** (such as the outward‑directed “receding” force in true circular motion) can be identified, allowing the laws to predict true motions regardless of any relative motion of the observer or of other bodies.  

Thus, Newton’s notion of absolute space‑time supplies the objective frame in which his laws are valid, while relative motion is merely a convenient, but non‑fundamental, description of motion relative to other bodies.
--------------------------------------------------
Q10: Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A10: Isaac Newton’s grandfather was Robert Newton.
--------------------------------------------------
Q11: Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A11: No; beyond his grandfather Robert Newton, the document states that Isaac Newton’s further descent cannot be traced with certainty, mentioning only two family traditions (Scotch extraction or origins in Newton, Lancashire) but no other confirmed lineage.

77w? quantity of matter is the measure of the same, arising from its
density and hulk conjutictly.
THUS air of a double density, in a double space, is quadruple in quan-
ti t y ; i n a triple space, sextuple in quantity. The same thing is to be un
derstood of snow, and fine dust or powders, that are condensed by compres
sion or liquefaction • and of all bodies that are by any causes whatever
differently condensed. I have no regard in this place to a medium, if any
such there is, that freely pervades the interstices between the parts oi
bodies. It is this quantity that I mean hereafter everywhere under the
name of body or mass. And the same is known by the weight of each
body ; f or it is proportional to the weight, as I have found by experiments
on pendulums, very accurately made, which shall be shewn hereafter.

therefore in a body double in quantity, with equal velocity, the motion is

because the force with which the weight p presses the plane pQi is to the
force with which the same, whether by its own gravity, or by the blow of
a mallet, is impelled in the direction of the line joH towards both the
planes, as joN to pH ; and to the force with which it presses the other
plane pG, as joN to NH. And thus the force of the screw may be deduced
from a like resolution of forces ; i t being no other than a wedge impelled
with the force of a lever. Therefore the use of this Corollary spreads far
and wide, and by that diffusive extent the truth thereof is farther con
firmed. For on what has been said depends the whole doctrine of mechan
ics variously demonstrated by different authors. For from hence are easily
deduced the forces of machines, which are compounded of wheels, pullics,
levers, cords, and weights, ascending directly or obliquely, and other mechan
ical powers ; as also the force of the tendons to move the bones of animals.
COROLLARY III.
The (/uaittity of motion, which is collected by taking the sum of the mo
tions directed towards the same parts, and the difference of those that
are directed to contrary parts, suffers no change from the action oj
bodies among themselves.
For action and its opposite re-action are equal, by Law III, and there
fore, by Law II, they produce in the motions equal changes towards oppo
site parts. Therefore if the motions are directed towards the same parts.
whatever is added to the motion of the preceding body will be subducted
from the motion of that which follows ; so that the sum will be the same
as before. If the bodies meet, with contrary motions, there will be an
equal deduction from the motions of both ; and therefore the difference of
the motions directed towards opposite parts will remain the same.
Thus if a spherical body A with two parts of velocity is triple of a
spherical body B which follows in the same right line with ten parts of
velocity, the motion of A will be to that of B as 6 to 10. Suppose,
then, their motions to be of 6 parts and of 10 parts, and the sum will be
16 parts. Therefore, upon the meeting of the bodies, if A acquire 3, 4,
or 5 parts of motion, B will lose as many ; and therefore after reflexion
A will proceed With 9, 10, or 11 parts, and B with 7, 6, or 5 parts; the
sum remaining always of 16 parts as before. If the body A acquire 9,
10, 11, or 12 parts of motion, and therefore after meeting proceed with
15, 16, 17, or 18 parts, the body B, losing so many parts as A has got,
will either proceed with 1 part, having lost 9, or stop and remain at rest,
as having lost its whole progressive motion of 10 parts ; or it will go back

LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 33
The entire work bears the general title of THE MATHEMATICAL
PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. It consists of three books:
the first two, entitled, OF THE MOTION OF BODIES, are occupied
with the laws and conditions of motions and forces, and are illus
trated with many scholia treating of some of the most general
and best established points in philosophy, such as the density and
resistance of bodies, spaces void of matter, and the motion of
sound and light. From these principles, there is deduced, in the
third book, drawn up in as popular a style as possible and entitled,
OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD, the constitution of the system of
i he world. In regard to this book, the author say^ — " I h ad, indeed,
composed the third Book in a popular method, that it m ight be read
by many ; b ut afterwards, considering that such as had not suf-
ficently entered into the principles could not easily discover the
strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to which
they had been many years accustomed, therefore, to prevent dis
putes which might be raised upon such accounts, I c hose to reduce
the substance of this Book into the form of Propositions (in the
mathematical way), which should be read by those only who had
first made themselves masters of the principles established in the
preceding Books : not that I w ould advise any one to the previous
study of every Proposition of those Books." — "It is enough it
one carefully reads the Definitions, the Laws of Motion, and the
three first Sections of the first Book. He may then pass on to
this Book, and consult such of the remaining Propositions of the
first two Books, as the references in this, and his occasions shall re
quire." So that " The System of the World" is composed both
" in a popular method," and in the form of mathematical Propo
sitions.
The principle of Universal Gravi' ition, namely, that every
particle of matter is attracted by, or gravitates to, every other
particle of matter, icith a force inversely proportional to the
squares of their distances — is the discovery w? ich characterizes
The PRINCIPIA. This principle the author deduced from the mo
tion of the moon, and the three laws of Kepler — laws, which
Newton, in turn, by his greater law, demonstrated to be true.

AXIOMS, OR LAWS OF MOTION.
LAW I.
Hvery body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a ri^ht
line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed
thereon.
PROJECTILES persevere in their motions, so far as they are not retarded
by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of gravity
A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from
rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is re
tarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting
with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve then jDotions both pro
gressive and circular for a much longer time.
LAW II.
The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force imp reus
ed ; and is made in the direction of the right line in. which that force
is impressed.
If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the
motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed
altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion
(being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body
moved before, is added to or subducted from the former motion, according
as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other ; or
obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion
compounded from the determination of both.
LAW III.
To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction : or the mu
tual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and di
rected to contrary parts.
Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that
other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by
the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so
say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone: for the distended rope,
by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as
much towards the stone, as it does the stone towards the horse, and will
obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other.

76 THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES
DEFINITION VII.
The accelerative quantity of a centripetal force is the measure, of tht
same, proportional to the velocity which it generates in a given time.
Thus the force of the same load-stone is greater at a less distance, and
less at a greater : also the force of gravity is greater in valleys, less on
tops of exceeding high mountains ; a nd yet less (as shall hereafter be shown),
at greater distances from the body of the earth ; but at equal distan
ces, it is the same everywhere ; b ecause (taking away, or allowing for, the
resistance of the air), it equally accelerates all falling bodies, whether heavy
or light, great or small.
DEFINITION VIII.
TJie motive quantity of a centripetal force, is the measure of the samt\
proportional to the motion which it generates in a given twip.
Thus the weight is greater in a greater body, less in a less body ; and.
in the same body, it is greater near to the earth, and less at remoter dis
tances. This sort of quantity is the centripetency, or propension of the
whole body towards the centre, or, as I may say, its weight ; and it is al
ways known by the quantity of an equal and contrary force just sufficient
to Ifinder the descent of the body.
These quantities of forces, we may, for brevity's sake, call by the names
of motive, accelerative, and absolute forces ; and, for distinction's sake, con
sider them, with respect to the bodies that tend to the centre ; to the places
of those bodies ; and to the centre of force towards which they tend ; t hat
is to say, I refer the motive force to the body as an endeavour and propen
sity of the whole towards a centre, arising from the propensities of the
several parts taken together ; the accelerative force to the place of the
body, as a certain power or energy diffused from the centre to all places
around to move the bodies that are in them : and the absolute force to
the centre, as endued with some cause, without which those motive forces
would not be propagated through the spaces round about ; whether that
cause be some central body (siuh as is the load-stone, in the centre of the
magnetic force, or the earth in the centre of the gravitating force), or
anything else that does not yet appear. For I here design only to give a
mathematical notion of those forces, without considering their physical
causes and seats.
Wherefore the accelerative force will stand in the same relation to the
motive, as celerity does to motion. For the quantity of motion arises from
the celerity drawn into the quantity of matter : and the motive force arises
from the accelerative force drawn into the same quantity of matter. For
the sum of the actions of the accelerative force, upon the several ; a rticles
of the body, is the motive force of the whole. Hence it is, t hat near the

themselves, whether that space is at rest, or moves uniformly forwards
in a right line without any circular motion.
For the differences of the motions tending towards the same parts, and
the sums of those that tend towards contrary parts, are, at first (by sup
position), in both cases the same ; and it is from those sums and differences
that the collisions and impulses do arise with which the bodies mutually
impinge one upon another. Wherefore (by Law II), the effects of those
collisions will be equal in both cases ; and therefore the mutual motions
of the bodies among themselves in the one case will remain equal to the
mutual motions of the bodies among themselves in the other. A clear
proof of which we have from the experiment of a ship ; where all motions
happen after the same manner, whether the ship is at rest, or is carried
uniformly forwards in a right line.
COROLLARY VI.
If bodies, any how moved among themselves, are urged in the direct-ton
of parallel lines by equal accelerative forces, they will all continue to
move among themselves, after the same manner as if they had been
urged by no such forces.
For these forces acting equally (with respect to the quantities of the
DO dies to be moved), and in the direction of parallel lines, will (by Law II)
move all the bodies equally (as to velocity), and therefore will never pro
duce any change in the positions or motions of the bodies among themselves.
SCHOLIUM.
Hitherto I have laid down such principles as have been received by math
ematicians, and are confirmed by abundance of experiments. By the first
two Laws and the first two Corollaries, Galileo discovered that the de
scent of bodies observed the duplicate ratio of the time, and that the mo
tion of projectiles was in the curve of a parabola; experience agreeing
with both, unless so far as these motions are a little retarded by the re
sistance of the air. When a body is falling, the uniform force of its
gravity acting equally, impresses, in equal particles of time, equal forces
upon that body, and therefore generates equal velocities; and in the whole
time impresses a whole force, and generates a whole velocity proportional
to the time. And the spaces described in proportional times are as the
velocities and the times conjunctly ; t hat is, i n a duplicate ratio of the
times. And when a body is thrown upwards, its uniform gravity im
presses forces and takes off velocities proportional to the times ; and the
times of ascending to the greatest heights are as the velocities to be taken
off, and those heights are as the velocities and the times conjunetly, or ir,
the duplicate ratio of the velocities. And if a body be projected in any
direction, the motion arising from its projection jS compounded with the

or change the velocity of the body in that path, but only draw it aside
from a rectilinear course, and make it deflect perpetually from the tangent
of the orbit, and proceed in the curvilinear path ITK/j. That whole
force, therefore, will be spent in producing this effect: but the other force
IT, acting in the direction of the course of the body, will be all employed
in accelerating it, and in the least given time will produce an acceleration
proportional to itself. Therefore the accelerations of the bodies in D and
I, p roduced in equal times, are as the lines DE, IT (if we take the first
ratios of the nascent lines DE, IN, IK, IT, NT) ; and in unequal times as
those lines and the times conjunctly. But the times in which DE and IK
are described, are, by reason of the equal velocities (in D and I) a s the
spaces described DE and IK, and therefore the accelerations in the course
of the bodies through the lines DE and IK are as DE and IT, and DE
and IK conjunctly ; that is, as the square of DE to the rectangle IT into
IK. But the rectangle IT X IK is equal to the square of IN, that is,
equal to the square of DE ; and therefore the accelerations generated in
the passage of the bodies from D and I to E and K are equal. Therefore
the velocities of the holies in E and K are also equal, and by the same

LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON. 33
The entire work bears the general title of THE MATHEMATICAL
PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. It consists of three books:
the first two, entitled, OF THE MOTION OF BODIES, are occupied
with the laws and conditions of motions and forces, and are illus
trated with many scholia treating of some of the most general
and best established points in philosophy, such as the density and
resistance of bodies, spaces void of matter, and the motion of
sound and light. From these principles, there is deduced, in the
third book, drawn up in as popular a style as possible and entitled,
OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD, the constitution of the system of
i he world. In regard to this book, the author say^ — " I h ad, indeed,
composed the third Book in a popular method, that it m ight be read
by many ; b ut afterwards, considering that such as had not suf-
ficently entered into the principles could not easily discover the
strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to which
they had been many years accustomed, therefore, to prevent dis
putes which might be raised upon such accounts, I c hose to reduce
the substance of this Book into the form of Propositions (in the
mathematical way), which should be read by those only who had
first made themselves masters of the principles established in the
preceding Books : not that I w ould advise any one to the previous
study of every Proposition of those Books." — "It is enough it
one carefully reads the Definitions, the Laws of Motion, and the
three first Sections of the first Book. He may then pass on to
this Book, and consult such of the remaining Propositions of the
first two Books, as the references in this, and his occasions shall re
quire." So that " The System of the World" is composed both
" in a popular method," and in the form of mathematical Propo
sitions.
The principle of Universal Gravi' ition, namely, that every
particle of matter is attracted by, or gravitates to, every other
particle of matter, icith a force inversely proportional to the
squares of their distances — is the discovery w? ich characterizes
The PRINCIPIA. This principle the author deduced from the mo
tion of the moon, and the three laws of Kepler — laws, which
Newton, in turn, by his greater law, demonstrated to be true.

Content: The demonstration of this Proposition may be more diffusely explained
after the following manner. Suppose several moons to revolve about the
earth, as in the system of Jupiter or Saturn : the periodic times of these
moons (by the argument of induction) would observe the same law which
Kepler found to obtain among the planets ; and therefore their centripetal
forces would be reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the centre
of the earth, by Prop. I, o f this Book. Now if the lowest of these were
very small, and were so near the earth as almost to touo the tops of the
highest mountains, the centripetal force thereof, retaining it in its orb,
would be very nearly equal to the weights of any terrestrial bodies that
should be found upon the tops of those mountains, as may be known by
the foregoing computation. Therefore if the same little moon should be
deserted by its centrifugal force that carries it through its orb, and so be

the bodies from the tangents PR, pr to the arcs PQ, pq, through the in
tervals proportional to them RQ,, rq ; and therefore this last force (tending
to s) would make the body p revolve in the curve pqv, which would becomr
similar to the curve PQV, in which the first force obliges the body P i(
revolve ; and their revolutions would be completed in the same timeg
But because those forces are not to each other in the ratio of CP to sp, bu;
(by reason of the similarity and equality of the bodies S and s, P and /
and the equality of the distances SP, sp) mutually equal, the bodies ii
equal times will be equally drawn from the tangents; and therefore tLV
the body p may be attracted through the greater interval rq, there is re
quired a greater time, which will be in the subduplicate ratio of the inter
vals ; b ecause, by Lemma X, the spaces described at the very beginning ol
the motion are in a duplicate ratio of the times. Suppose, then the velocity
of the body p to be to the velocity of the body P in a subduplicate ratio of
the distance sp to the distance CP, so that the arcs pq, PQ, which are in a
simple proportion to each other, may be described in times that are in n
subduplicate ratio of the distances ; and the bodies P, p, always attracted
by equal forces, will describe round the quiescent centres C and s similar
figures PQV, pqv, the latter of which pqv is similar and equal to the figure
ivhich the body P describes round the movable body S. Q.E.I)
CASE 2. Suppose now that the common centre of gravity, together with
the space in which the bodies are moved among themselves, proceeds uni
formly in a right line ; and (by Cor. 6, of the Laws of Motion) all the mo
tions in this space will be performed in the same manner as before ; and
therefore the bodies will describe mutually about each other the same fig
ures as before, which will be therefore similar and equal to the figure pqv.
Q.E.D.
COR. 1. Hence two bodies attracting each other with forces proportional
to their distance, describe (by Prop. X) both round their common centre ol
gravity, and round each other mutually concentrical ellipses ; and, vice
versa, if such figures are described, the forces are proportional to the dis
tances.
COR. 2. And two bodies, whose forces are reciprocally proportional to
the square of their distance, describe (by Prop. XI, XII, XIII), both round
their common centre of gravity, and round each other mutually, conic sec
tions having their focus in the centre about which the figures are described.
And, vice versa, if such figures are described, the centripetal forces are re
ciprocally proportional to the squares of the distance.

PROPOSITION VIII. THEOREM VIII.
Tn two spheres mutually gravitating each towards the other, if t lie matter
in places on all sides round about and equi-distant from the centres is
similar, the weight of either sphere towards the other will be recipro
cally as the square of the distance between their centres.
After I had found that the force of gravity towards a whole planet did
arise from and was compounded of the forces of gravity towards all its
parts, and towards every one part was in the reciprocal proportion of the
squares of the distances from the part, I was yet in doubt whether that re
ciprocal duplicate proportion did accurately hold, or but nearly so, in the
total force compounded of so many partial ones; for it might be that the
proportion which accurately enough took place in greater distances should
be wide of the truth near the surface of the planet, where the distances of
the particles are unequal, and their situation dissimilar. But by the help
of Prop. LXXV and LXXVI, Book I, a nd their Corollaries, I was at last
satisfied of the truth of the Proposition, as it now lies before us.
COR. 1. Hence we may find and compare together the weights of bodies
towards different planets ; f or the weights of bodies revolving in circles
about planets are (by Cor. 2, Prop. IV, Book I) a s the diameters of the
circles directly, and the squares of their periodic times reciprocally ; and
their weights at the surfaces of the planets, or at any other distances from
their centres, are (by this Prop.) greater or less in the reciprocal duplicate
proportion of the distances. Thus from the periodic times of Venus, re
volving about the sun, in 224<J. 16fh, of the utmost circumjovial satellite
revolving about Jupiter, in 16'. 10 -?/. ; of the Huygenian satellite about
Saturn in 15d. 22f h. ; and of the moon about the earth in 27d. 7h. 43' ;
compared with the mean distance of Venus from the sun, and with the
greatest heliocentric elongations of the outmost circumjovial satellite
from Jupiter's centre, 8' 16"; of the Huygenian satellite from the centre
of Saturn, 3' 4" ; arid of the moon from the earth, 10' 33" : by computa
tion I found that the weight of equal bodies, at equal distances from the
centres of the sun, of Jupiter, of Saturn, and of the earth, towards the sun,
Jupiter, Saturn, and the earth, were one to another, as 1, T^VT> ^oVr? an^
___i___ respectively. Then because as the distances are increased or di
minished, the weights are diminished or increased in a duplicate ratio, the
weights of equal bodies towards the sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and the earth,

bodies from, the common centre, as in respect of the distance between

For those forces with which the bodies attract each other mutually, by
tending to the bodies, tend also to the common centre of gravity lying di

And because there is given the ratio of the distance of either body from
that common centre to the distance between the two bodies, there is given,
of course, the ratio of any power of one distance to the same power of the

same force with which the same body is attracted to the common centre of
gravity be in like manner directly or inversely as the distance of the at
tracted body from the common centre, or as any power of that distance ;
or, lastly, as a quantity derived in like sort from that distance compounded
with analogous given quantities. That is, t he law of attracting force will

To determine the motions of two bodies which attract each other with
forces reciprocally proportional to the squares of the distance between
them, aflid are, let fall from given places.
The bodies, by the last Theorem, will be moved in the same manner as
if they were attracted by a third placed in the common centre of their
gravity ; and by the hypothesis that centre will be quiescent at the begin
ning of their motion, and therefore (by Cor. 4, o f the Laws of Motion) will
be always quiescent. The motions of the bodies are therefore to be deter
mined (by Prob. XXV) in the same manner as if they were impelled by
forces tending to that centre: and then we shall have the motions of the
bodies attracting each other mutually. Q.E.I.

the latter, or with its reciprocal. And if any one is said to be as any other

others, or the reciprocals of the others, are augmented or diminished. As

CASE 1. Let AB be that arc, AD its tangent, BD
the subtense of the angle of contact perpendicular on
the tangent, AB the subtense of the arc. Draw BG
perpendicular to the subtense AB, and AG to the tan
gent AD, meeting in G ; t hen let the points D, B, and
G. approach to the points d, b, a nd g, and suppose J
to be the ultimate intersection of the lines BG, AG,
when the points D, B, have come to A. It is evident
that the distance GJ may be less than any assignable.
But (from the nature of the circles passing through
the points A, B, G, A, b, g ,) AE2= AG X BD, and
A62 = Ag X bd ; and therefore the ratio of AB2 to Ab2 is compounded oi
the ratios of AG to Ag, and of Ed to bd. But because GJ may be as
sumed of less length than any assignable, the ratio of AG to Ag may be
such as to differ from the ratio of equality by less than any assignable
difference ; and therefore the ratio of AB2 to Ab2 may be such as to differ
from the ratio of BD to bd by less than any assignable difference. There

By bodies of the same density, I mean those whose vires inertia are in the
proportion of their bulks.
COR. 5. The power of gravity is of a different nature from the power of
magnetism ; f or the magnetic attraction is not as the matter attracted.
Some bodies are attracted more by the magnet ; others less ; most bodies
not at all. The power of magnetism in one and the same body may be
increased and diminished ; and is sometimes far stronger, for the quantity
of matter, than the power of gravity ; and in receding from the magnet
decreases not in the duplicate but almost in the triplicate proportion of the
distance, as nearly as I could judge from some rude observations.
PROPOSITION VII. THEOREM VII.
That there is a power of gravity tending to all bodies, proportional to
the several quantities of matter which they contain.
That all the planets mutually gravitate one towards another, we have
proved before ; a s well as that the force of gravity towards every one of them,
considered apart, is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from
the centre of the planet. And thence (by Prop. LXIX, Book I, a nd its
Corollaries) it follows, that the gravity tending towards all the planets is
proportional to the matter which they contain.
Moreover, since all the parts of any planet A gravitate towards any
other planet B ; and the gravity of every part is to the gravity of the
whole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole ; and (by Law
III) to every action corresponds an equal re-action ; t herefore the planet B
will, on the other hand, gravitate towards all the parts of the planet A ;
and its gravity towards any one part will be to the gravity towards the
whole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole. Q.E.D.
COR, 1. Therefore the force of gravity towards any whole planet arises
from, and is compounded of, the forces of gravity towards all its parts.
Magnetic and electric attractions afford us examples of this ; f or all at
traction towards the whole arises from the attractions towards the several
parts. The thing may be easily understood in gravity, if we consider a
greater planet, as formed of a number of lesser planets, meeting together in
one globe ; f or hence it would appear that the force of the whole must
arise from the forces of the component parts. If it is objected, that, ac
cording to this law, all bodies with us must mutually gravitate one to
wards another, whereas no such gravitation any where appears, I answer,
that since the gravitation towards these bodies is to the gravitation towards
the whole earth as these bodies are to the whole earth, the gravitation to
wards them must be far less than to fall under the observation of our senses.
COR. 2. The force of gravity towards the several equal particles of any
body is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from the parti
cles ; as appears from Cor. 3, Prop. LXXIV, Book I.

Content: the action of the circum-solar force upon all the planets (reduced to equal
distances) is as the matter of the planets ; t hat the action of the circum-
jovial force upon the satellites of Jupiter observes the same law ; and the
same thing is to be said of the attraction of all the planets towards every
planet : but thence it follows (by Prop. LXIX) that their attractive forces
are as their several quantities of matter.
As the parts of the earth mutually attract one another, so do those of
all the planets. If Jupiter and its satellites were brought together, and
formed into one globe, without doubt they would continue mutually to
attract one another as before. And, on the other hand, if the body of
Jupiter was broke into more globes, to be sure, these would no less attract.

that the force which retained the planet in its orbit was always
directed to the sun ; and from the second, namely, that every
planet moves in an ellipse with the sun in one of its foci, he drew
the more general inference that the force by which the planet
moves round that focus varies inversely as the square of its dis
tance therefrom : and he demonstrated that a planet acted upon
by such a force could not move in any other curve than a conic
section ; showing when the moving body would describe a circu
lar, an elliptical, a parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit. He demon
strated, too, that this force, or attracting, gravitating power re
sided in every, the least particle ; b ut that, in spherical masses, it
operated as if confined to their centres ; so that, one sphere or
body will act upon another sphere or body, with a force directly
proportional to the quantity of matter, and inversely as the square
of the distance between their centres; and that their velocities of
mutual approach will be in the inverse ratio of their quantities o*'
matter. Thus he grandly outlined the Universal Law. Verify
ing its truth by the motions of terrestrial bodies, then by those of
the moon and other secondary orbs, he finally embraced, in one
mighty generalization, the entire Solar System — all the move
ments of all its bodies — planets, satellites and comets — explain

In such bodies as are found on our earth of very different sorts, I exam

velocity in equal times, and will make all bodies let fall to descend through
equal spaces in equal times, and all bodies hung by equal threads to vibrate

more or less diminution ? The conjecture appeared most proba
ble : and, in order to estimate what the degree of diminution
might be, he considered that if the moon be retained in her orbit
by the force of gravity, the primary planets must also be carried
round the sun by the like power; and, by comparing the periods
of the several planets with their distances from the sun, he found
that, if they were held in their courses by any power like gravity,
its strength must decrease in the duplicate proportion of the in
crease of distance. In forming this conclusion, he supposed the
planets to move in perfect circles, concentric to the sun. Now
was this the law of the moon's motion ? Was such a force, em
anating from the earth and directed to the moon, sufficient, when
diminished as the square of the distance, to retain her in her
orbit ? To ascertain this master-fact, he compared the space
through which heavy bodies fall, in a second of time, at a given
distance from the centre of the earth, namely, at its surface, with
the space through which the moon falls, as it were, to the earth,
in the same time, while revolving in a circular orbit. He was
absent from books ; and, therefore, adopted, in computing the
earth's diameter, the common estimate of sixty miles to a degree
of latitude as then in use among geographers and navigators.
The result of his calculations did not, ot course, answer his ex
pectations ; h ence, he concluded that some other cause, beyond the
reach of observation — analogous, perhaps, to the vortices of Des
cartes — joined its action to that of the power of gravity upon the
rnooil. Though by no means satisfied, he yet abandoned awhile
further inquiry, and remained totally silent upon the subject.
These rapid marches in the career of discovery, combined with
the youth of Newton, seem to evince a penetration the most
lively, and an invention the most exuberant. But in him there
was a conjunction of influences as extraordinary as fortunate.

situate in the plane of the orbit PAB, will have the same effect as before ;
neither will it draw the body P from the plane of its orbit. But the other
force NM acting in the direction of a line parallel to ST (and which, there
fore, when the body S is without the line of the nodes is inclined to the
plane of the orbit PAB), besides the perturbation of the motion just now
spoken of as to longitude, introduces another perturbation also as to latitude,
attracting the body P out of the plane of its orbit. And this perturbation,
in any given situation of the bodies P and T to each other, will be as the
generating force MN ; and therefore becomes least when the force MN is

the system of two or more revolving bodies, the greater will the pertur
bation be of the motions of the parts of the system among themselves; be
cause the inclinations of the lines drawn from that great body to those
parts become greater ; and the inequality of the proportion is also greater.
COR. 2. But the perturbation will be greatest of all, if we suppose the
uccelerative attractions of the parts of the system towards the greatest body
of all are not to each other reciprocally as the squares of the distances
from that great body ; especially if the inequality of this proportion be
greater than the inequality of the proportion of the distances from the
great body. For if the accelerative force, acting in parallel directions
and equally, causes no perturbation in the motions of the parts of the
system, it must of course, when it acts unequally, cause a perturbation some
where, which will be greater or less as the inequality is greater or less.
The excess of the greater impulses acting upon some bodies, and not acting
upon others, must necessarily change their situation among themselves. And
this perturbation, added to the perturbation arising from the inequality
and inclination of the lines, makes the whole perturbation greater.
COR. '*. Hence if the parts of this system move in ellipses or circles
without any remarkable perturbation, it is manifest that, if they are at all
impelled by accelerative forces tending to any other bodies, the impulse is
very weak, or else is impressed very near equally and in parallel directions
upon all of them.
PROPOSITION LXVL THEOREM XXVI.
Tf three bodies whose forces decrease in a duplicate ratio of the distances
attract each other mutually ; and the accelerative attractions of any
two towards the third be between themselves reciprocally as the squares,
of the distances ; and the two least revolve about the greatest ; I say,
that the interior of the tivo revolving bodies will, by radii drawn to the
innermost and greatest, describe round thai body areas more propor
tional to the times, and a f igure more approaching to that of an ellip
sis having its focus in the point of concourse of the radii, if t hat great
body be agitated by those attractions, than it would do if lhat great
body were not attracted at all by the lesser, but remained at rest ; or
than it would if that great body were very much more or very much
less attracted, <>r very much more or very much less agitated, by the
attractions.
This appears plainly enough from the demonstration of the second
Corollary of tl.e foregoing Proposition; but it may be made out after
this manner by a way of reasoning more distinct and more universally
convincing.

is differently situated in these conjunctions, its eccentricity is sometimes
augmented, sometimes diminished; its aphelion is sometimes carried for
ward, sometimes backward, and its mean motion is by turns accelerated and
retarded ; yet the whole error in its motion about the sun, though arising
from so great a force, may be almost avoided (except in the mean motion)
by placing the lower focus of its orbit in the common centre of gravity of
Jupiter and the sun (according to Prop. LXVII, Book I), a nd therefore that
error, when it is greatest, scarcely exceeds two minutes ; and the greatest
error in the mean motion scarcely exceeds two minutes yearly. But in the
conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, the accelerative forces of gravity of the
sun towards Saturn, of Jupiter towards Saturn, and of Jupiter towards the
sun, are almost as 16, 81, and - ~o^~~ — > o r 156609: and therefore
the difference of the forces of gravity of the sun towards Saturn, and of
Jupiter towards Saturn, is to the force of gravity of Jupiter towards the
sun as 65 to 156609, or as 1 to 2409. But the greatest power of Saturn
to disturb the motion of Jupiter is proportional to this difference; and
therefore the perturbation of the orbit of Jupiter is much less than that of
Saturn's. The perturbations of the other orbits are yet far less, except that
the orbit of the earth is sensibly disturbed by the moon. The common
centre of gravity of the earth and moon moves in an ellipsis about the sun
in the focus thereof, and, by a radius drawn to the sun, describes areas pro
portional to the times of description. But the earth in the mean time by
a menstrual motion is revolved about this common centre.
PROPOSITION XIV. THEOREM XIV.
The aphelions and nodes of the orbits of the planets are fixed.
The aphelions are immovable by Prop. XI, Book I ; and so are the
planes of the orbits, by Prop. I of the same Book. And if the planes are
fixed, the nodes must be so too. It is true, that some inequalities may
arise from the mutual actions of the planets and comets in their revolu
tions ; b ut these will be so small, that they may be here passed by.
COR. 1. The fixed stars are immovable, seeing they keep the same posi
tion to the aphelions and nodes of the planets.
COR. 2. And since these stars are liable to no sensible parallax from the
annual motion of the earth, they can have no force, because of their im
mense distance, to produce any sensible effect in our system. Not to
mention that the fixed stars, every where promiscuously dispersed in the
heavens, by their contrary attractions destroy their mutual actions, by
Prop. LXX, Book I.

Mars) are so small that they can act with but little force upon each other,
therefore their aphelions and nodes must be fixed, excepting in so far as
they are disturbed by the actions of Jupiter and Saturn, and other higher
bodies. And hence we may find, by the theory of gravity, that their aphe
lions move a little in consequentw, in respect of the fixed stars, and that
in the sesqui plicate proportion of their several distances from the sun. So
that if the aphelion of Mars, in the space of a hundred years, is carried

Earth, of Venus, and of Mercury, will in a hundred years be carried for

To find the principal diameters <>f t he orbits of the planets.
They are to be taken in the sub-sesquiplicate proportion of the periodic
times, by Prop. XV, Book I, a nd then to be severally augmented in the
proportion of the sum of the masses of matter in the sun and each planet
to the first of two mean proportionals betwixt that sum and the quantity of
matter in the sun, by Prop. LX, Book I.
PROPOSITION XVI. PROBLEM II.
To find the eccentricities and aphelions of the planets.
This Problem is resolved by Prop. XVIII, Book I.
PROPOSITION XVII. THEOREM XV.
That the diurnal motions of the planets are uniform, and that the
libration of the moon arises from its diurnal motion.
The Proposition is proved from the first Law of Motion, and Cor. 22,
Prop. LXVI, Book I. Jupiter, with respect to the fixed stars, revolves in
9'1. 5(5 ; M ars in 24h. 39' ; V enus in about 23h. ; t he Earth in 23'1. 56' ; t he
Sun in 25 1 days, and the moon in 27 days, 7 hours, 43'. These things
appear by the Phasnomena. The spots in the sun's body return to the
same situation on the sun's disk, with respect to the earth, in 27 ± days ; a nd
therefore with respect to the fixed stars the sun revolves in about 25|days.
But because the lunar day, arising from its uniform revolution about its
axis, is menstrual, that is, equal to the time of its periodic revolution in
its orb, therefore the same face of the moon wrill be always nearly turned to
the upper focus of its orb ; b ut, as the situation of that focus requires, will

means, not so much to store the memory with symbols and facts,
as to bring forth the faculties of the soul and develope them to the

necessary to the successful prosecution of researches in the higher
branches of philosophy. But has not the Analytical encroached
upon the Synthetical, and Algorithmic Formulae been employed
when not requisite, either for the evolution of truth, or even its
apter illustration ? To each method belongs, undoubtedly, an
appropriate use. Newton, himself the inventor of Fluxions,
censured the handling of Geometrical subjects by Algebraical
calculations ; and the maturest opinions which he expressed were
additionally in favour of the Geometrical Method. His prefer

14 LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON
His early and fast friend, Dr. Barrow — in compass of inven
tion only inferior to Newton — who had been elected Professor
of Greek in the University, in 1660, was made Lucasian Profes
sor of Mathematics in 1663, and soon afterward delivered his
Optical Lectures : the manuscripts of these were revised by New
ton, and several oversights corrected, and many important sug
gestions made by him ; b ut they were not published till 1669.
In the year 1665, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts ;
and, in 1666, he entered upon those brilliant and imposing dis
coveries which have conferred inappreciable benefits upon science,
and immortality upon his own name.
Newton, himself, states that he was in possession of his Method
of Fluxions, " in the year 1666, or before." Infinite quantities
had long been a subject of profound investigation ; among the
ancients by Archimedes, and Pappus of Alexandria ; among the
moderns by Kepler, Cavaleri, Roberval, Fermat and Wallis.
With consummate ability Dr. Wallis had improved upon the la-
hours of his predecessors : with a higher power, Newton moved
forwards from where Wallis stopped. Our author first invented
his celebrated BINOMIAL THEOREM. And then, applying this
Theorem to the rectification of curves, and to the determination
of the surfaces and contents of solids, and the position of their
centres of gravity, he discovered the general principle of deducing
the areas of curves from the ordinate, by considering the area as
a nascent quantity, increasing by continual fluxion in the propor
tion of the length of the ordinate, and supposing the abscissa
to increase uniformly in proportion to the time. Regarding lines
as generated by the motion of points, surfaces by the motion of
lines, and solids by the motion of surfaces, and considering that
the ordinates, abscissae, &c., of curves thus formed, vary accord
ing to a regular law depending on the equation of the curve,
he deduced from this equation the velocities with which these
quantities are generated, and obtained by the rules of infinite
series, the ultimate value required. To the velocities with which
every line or quantity is generated, he gave the name of FLUX
IONS, and to the lines or quantities themselves, that of FLUENTS.

Principia Mathematicia ; and thereupon I had altered it to this,
De Motu Corporum Libri duo. But after second thought I re
tain the former title. It will help the sale of the book, which I
ought not to diminish now 'tis yours."
This " warning" arose from some pretensions put forth by Dr.
Hooke. And though Newton gave a minute and positive refuta
tions of such claims, yet, to reconcile all differences, he gener
ously added to Prop. IV. Cor. 6, Book I, a Scholium, in which
Wren, Hooke and Halley are acknowledged to have indepen
dently deduced the law of gravity from the second law of
Kepler.
The suppression of the third book Dr. Halley could not endure
to see. " I must again beg you" says he, " not to let your re
sentments run so high as to deprive us of your third book, where
in your applications of your mathematical doctrine to the theory
of comets, and several curious experiments, which, as I guess by
what you write ought to compose it, will undoubtedly render it
acceptable to those who will call themselves philosophers without
mathematics, which are much the greater number." To these
solicitations Newton yielded. There were no "resentments," how
ever, as we conceive, in his " d esign to suppress." He sought
peace ; f or he loved and valued it above all applause. But, in
spite of his efforts for tranquillity's sake, his course of discovery
was all along molested by ignorance or presumptuous rivalry.
The publication of the great work now went rapidly forwards,
The second book was sent to the Society, and presented on the
2d March ; t he third, on the 6th April ; and the whole was com
pleted and published in the month of May, 1686-7. In the sec
ond Lemma of the second book, the fundamental principle of his
fiuxionary calculus was, for the first time, given to the world ; b ut
its algorithm or notation did not appear till published in the
second volume nf Dr. Wallis's works, in 1693.
And thus was ushered into existence The PRINCIPIA — a work
to which pre-eminence above all the productions of the human
intellect has been awarded — a work that must be esteemed of
priceless worth so long as Science has a votary, or a single wor
shipper be left to kneel at the altar of Truth.

INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.
THAT the PRINCIPIA of Newton should have remained so gen
erally unknown in this country to the present day is a somewhat
remarkable fact ; b ecause the name of the author, learned with
the very elements of science, is revered at every hearth-stone
where knowledge and virtue are of chief esteem, while, abroad,
in all the high places of the land, the character which that name
recalls is held up as the noblest illustration of what MAN may be,
and may do, in the possession and manifestation of pre-eminent
intellectual and moral worth ; b ecause the work is celebrated, not
only in the history of one career and one mind, but in the history
of all achievement and human reason itself; because of the spirit
of inquiry, which has been aroused, and which, in pursuing its
searchings, is not always satisfied with stopping short of the foun
tain-head of any given truth ; and, finally, because of the earnest
endeavour that has been and is constantly going on, in many
sections of the Republic, to elevate the popular standard of edu
cation and give to scientific and other efforts a higher and a
better aim.
True, the PRINCIPIA has been hitherto inaccessible to popular
use. A few copies in Latin, and occasionally one in English may
be found in some of our larger libraries, or in the possession of
some ardent disciple of the great Master. But a d^ad language
in the one case, and an enormous price in both, particularly in
that of the English edition, have thus far opposed very sufficient
obstacles to the wide circulation of the work. It is now, how
ever, placed within the reach of all. And in performing this la
bour, the utmost care has been taken, by collation, revision, and
otherwise, to render the First American Edition the most accurate
and beautiful in our language. u Le plus beau monument que

" I. Mr. Leibnitz was in London in the beginning of the year
1673 ; and went thence in or about March, to Paris, where he
kept a correspondence with Mr. Collins, by means of Mr. Olden
burg, till about September, 1676, and then returned, by London
and Amsterdam, to Hanover: and that Mr. Collins was very free
in communicating to able mathematicians what he had received
from Mr, Newton and Mr. Gregory.
" II. That when Mr. Leibnitz was the first time in London,
he contended for the invention of another differential method,
properly so called ; and, notwithstanding he was shown by Dr.
Pell that it was Newton?s method, persisted in maintaining it to
be his own invention, by reason that he had found it by himself
without knowing what Newton had done before, and had much
improved it. And we find no mention of his having any other
differential method than Newton's before his letter of the 21st of
June, 1677, which was a year after a copy of Mr. Newton's letter
of the 10th of December, 1672, had been sent to Paris to be
communicated to him ; and above four years after Mr. Collins
began to communicate that letter to his correspondents ; i n which
letter the method of fluxions was sufficiently described to any
intelligent person.
"III. That by Mr. Newton's letter, of the 13th of June, 1676
it appears that he had the method of fluxions above five years
before the writing of that letter. And by his Analysis per ^Equa-
tiones numero Terminorum Infmitas, communicated by Dr. Barrow
to Mr. Collins, in July, 1669, we find that he had invented the
method before that time.
"IV. That the differential method is one and the same with
the method of fluxions, excepting the name and mode of notation ;
Mr. Leibnitz calling those quantities differences which Mr. Newton
calls moments, or fluxions ; and marking them with a letter d — a
mark not used by Mr. Newton.
" A nd, therefore, we take the proper question to be, not who
invented this or that method, but, who was the first inventor of
the method ? And we believe that those who have reputed Mr.
Leibnitz the first inventor knew little or nothing of his correspond
ence with Mr. Collins and Mr. Oldenburg long before, nor of Mr.

after the following manner. Suppose several moons to revolve about the
earth, as in the system of Jupiter or Saturn : the periodic times of these
moons (by the argument of induction) would observe the same law which
Kepler found to obtain among the planets ; and therefore their centripetal
forces would be reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the centre
of the earth, by Prop. I, o f this Book. Now if the lowest of these were
very small, and were so near the earth as almost to touo the tops of the
highest mountains, the centripetal force thereof, retaining it in its orb,
would be very nearly equal to the weights of any terrestrial bodies that
should be found upon the tops of those mountains, as may be known by
the foregoing computation. Therefore if the same little moon should be

SECTION VIII.
Of the invention of orbits wherein bodies will revolve, being acted upon
by any sort of centripetal force.
PROPOSITION XL. THEOREM XIII.
//' a body, acted upon by any centripetal force, is any how moved, and
another body ascends or descends in a right line, and their velocities
be equal in amj one case of equal altitudes, t/ieir velocities will be also
equal at all equal altitudes.
Let a body descend from A through D and E, to the centre
(j : and let another body move from V in the curve line VIK&.
From the centre C, with any distances, describe the concentric
circles DI, EK, meeting the right line AC in I) and E; and
the curve VIK in I and K. Draw 1C meeting KE in N, and
on IK let fall the perpendicular NT • and let the interval DE
or IN between the circumferences of the circles be very small ; K/
and imagine the bodies in D and I to have equal velocities.
Then because the distances CD and CI are equal, the centri
petal forces in D and I will be also equal. Let those forces be k)
expressed by the equal lineoke DE and IN ; and let the force
IN (by Cor. 2 of the Laws of Motion) be resolved into two
others, NT and IT. rl h en the force NT acting in the direction
line NT perpendicular to the path ITK of the body will not at all affect
or change the velocity of the body in that path, but only draw it aside
from a rectilinear course, and make it deflect perpetually from the tangent
of the orbit, and proceed in the curvilinear path ITK/j. That whole
force, therefore, will be spent in producing this effect: but the other force
IT, acting in the direction of the course of the body, will be all employed
in accelerating it, and in the least given time will produce an acceleration
proportional to itself. Therefore the accelerations of the bodies in D and
I, p roduced in equal times, are as the lines DE, IT (if we take the first
ratios of the nascent lines DE, IN, IK, IT, NT) ; and in unequal times as
those lines and the times conjunctly. But the times in which DE and IK
are described, are, by reason of the equal velocities (in D and I) a s the
spaces described DE and IK, and therefore the accelerations in the course
of the bodies through the lines DE and IK are as DE and IT, and DE
and IK conjunctly ; that is, as the square of DE to the rectangle IT into
IK. But the rectangle IT X IK is equal to the square of IN, that is,
equal to the square of DE ; and therefore the accelerations generated in
the passage of the bodies from D and I to E and K are equal. Therefore
the velocities of the holies in E and K are also equal, and by the same

may discover the proportion of a centripetal force to any other known
force, such as that of gravity. For if a body by means of its gravity re
volves in a circle concentric to the earth, this gravity is the centripetal
force of that body. But from the descent of heavy bodies, the time of one
entire revolution, as well as the arc described in any given time, is given
(by Cor. 9 of this Prop.). And by such propositions, Mr. Huygens, in his
excellent book De Horologio Oscillatorio, has compared the force of
gravity with the centrifugal forces of revolving bodies.
The preceding Proposition may be likewise demonstrated after this
manner. In any circle suppose a polygon to be inscribed of any number
of sides. And if a body, moved with a given velocity along the sides of the
polygon, is reflected from the circle at the several angular points, the force,
with which at every reflection it strikes the circle, will be as its velocity :
and therefore the sum of the forces, in a given time, will be as that ve
locity and the number of reflections conjunctly ; t hat is (if the species of
the polygon be given), as the length described in that given time, and in
creased or diminished in the ratio of the same length to the radius of the
circle ; t hat is, a s the square of that length applied to the radius ; and
therefore the polygon, by having its sides diminished in'inftnitum, coin
cides with the circle, as the square of the arc described in a given time ap
plied to the radius. This is the centrifugal force, with which the body
impels the circle ; and to which the contrary force, wherewith the circle
continually repels the body towards the centre, is equal.
PROPOSITION V. PROBLEM I.

the body P is retained in its orbit, is increased at the quadratures by tho
addition caused by the force LM, and diminished at the syzygies by the
subduction caused by the force KL, and, because the force KL is greater
than LM, it is more diminished than increased ; and, moreover, since that
centripetal force (by Cor. 2, Prop. IV) is in a ratio compounded of the sim
ple ratio of the radius TP directly, and the duplicate ratio of the periodi
cal time inversely ; i t is plain that this compounded ratio is diminished by
the action of the force KL ; a nd therefore that the periodical time, supposing
the radius of the orbit PT to remain the same, will be increased, and that
in the subduplicate of that ratio in which the centripetal force is diminish
ed ; and, therefore, supposing this radius increased or diminished, the peri
odical time will be increased more or diminished less than in the sesquipli-
cate ratio of this radius, by Cor. 6, Prop. IV. If that force of the central
body should gradually decay, the body P being less and less attracted would
go farther and farther from the centre T ; and, on the contrary, if it were
increased, it would draw nearer to it. Therefore if the action of the distant
body S, by which that force is diminished, were to increase and decrease
by turns, the radius TP will be also increased and diminshed by turns ;
and the periodical time will be increased and diminished in a ratio com
pounded of the sesquiplicate ratio of the radius, and of the subduplicate oi
that ratio in which the centripetal force of the central body T is dimin
ished or increased, by the increase or decrease of the action of the distant
body S.
COR. 7. It also follows, from what was before laid down, that the axis
of the ellipsis described by the body P, or the line of the apsides, does as
to its angular motion go forwards and backwards by turns, but more for
wards than backwards, and by the excess of its direct motion is in the
whole carried forwards. For the force with which the body P is urged to
the body T at the quadratures, where the force MN vanishes, is c ompound
ed of the force LM and the centripetal force with which the body T at
tracts the body P. The first force LM, if the distance PT be increased, is
increased in nearly the same proportion with that distance, and the other
force decreases in the duplicate ratio of the distance ; and therefore the
sum of these two forces decreases in a less than the duplicate ratio of the
distance PT ; and therefore, by Cor. 1, P rop. XLV, will make the line of
the apsides, or, which is the same thing, the upper apsis, to go backward.
But at the conjunction and opposition the force with which the body P is
urged towards the body T is the difference of the force KL, and of the

extreme swiftness, their resistances are nearly equal, whether the fluids
consist of gross parts, or of parts ever so subtile. For the resistance of

by the subtilty of the medium.

from the centrifugal forces of the particles. But if that force arise from
some other cause, as from the expansion of the particles after the manner
of wool, or the boughs of trees, or any other cause, by which the particles
are hindered from moving freely among themselves, the resistance, by
reason of the lesser fluidity of the medium, will be greater than in the

SCHOLIUM.
The resistance of spherical bodies in fluids arises partly from the tena
city, partly from the attrition, and partly from the density of the medium.
And that part of the resistance which arises from the density of the fluid
is, a s I said, in a duplicate ratio of the velocity ; the other part, which
arises from the tenacity of the fluid, is uniform, or as the moment of the
time ; and, therefore, we might now proceed to the motion of bodies, whicli
are resisted partly by an uniform force, or in the ratio of the moments of
the time, and partly in the duplicate ratio of the velocity. But it is suf
ficient to have cleared the way to this speculation in Prop. VIII and IX
foregoing, and their Corollaries. For in those Propositions, instead of the
uniform resistance made to an ascending body arising from its gravity,
one may substitute the uniform resistance which arises from the tenacity
of the medium, when the body moves by its vis insita alone ; and when the
body ascends in a right line, add this uniform resistance to the force of
gravity, and subduct it when the body descends in a right line. One
might also go on to the motion of bodies which are resisted in part uni
formly, in part in the ratio of the velocity, and in part in the duplicate
ratio of the same velocity. And I have opened a way to this in Prop.
XIII and XIV foregoing, in which the uniform resistance arising from the
tenacity of the medium may be substituted for the force of gravity, or be
compounded with it as before. But I hasten to other things.

QUESTION 9: In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
--------------------------------------------------

OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. 79
tions may be accelerated and retarded; but the true, or equable, progress of
absolute time is liable to no change. The duration or perseverance of the
existence of things remains the same, whether the motions are swift or slow,
or none at all : and therefore it ought to be distinguished from what are
only sensible measures thereof ; and out of which we collect it, b y means
of the astronomical equation. The necessity of which equation, for deter
mining the times of a phamomenon, is evinced as well from the experiments
of the pendulum clock, as by eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter.
As the order of the parts of time is immutable, so also is the order of
the parts of space. Suppose those parts to be moved out of their places, and
they will be moved (if the expression may be allowed) out of themselves.
For times and spaces are, as it were, the places as well of themselves as of
all other things. All things are placed in time as to order of succession ;
and in space as _to order of situation. It is from their essence or nature
that they are places ; and that the primary places of things should be
moveable, is absurd. These are therefore the absolute places ; and trans
lations out of those places, are the only absolute motions.
But because the parts of space cannot be seen, or distinguished from one
another by our senses, therefore in their stead we use sensible measures of
them. For from the positions and distances of things from any body con
sidered as immovable, we define all places ; and then with respect to such
places, we estimate all motions, considering bodies as transferred from some
of those places into others. And'so, instead of absolute places and motions,
we use relative ones; and that without any inconvenience in common af
fairs ; b ut in philosophical disquisitions, we ought to abstract from our
senses, and consider things themselves, distinct from what are only sensible
measures of them. For it may be that there is no body really at rest, to
which the places and motions of others may be referred.
But we may distinguish rest and motion, absolute and relative, one from
the other by their properties, causes and effects. It is a property of rest,
that bodies really at rest do rest in respect to one another. And therefore
as it is possible, that in the remote regions of the fixed stars, or perhaps
far beyond them, there may be some body absolutely at rest ; b ut impossi
ble to know, from the position of bodies to one another in our regions
whether any of these do keep the same position to that remote body; it
follows that absolute rest cannot be determined from the position of bodies
in our regions.
It is a property of motion, that the parts, which retain given positions
to their wholes, do partake of the motions of those wholes. For all the
parts of revolving bodies endeavour to recede from the axis of motion ;
and the impetus of bodies moving forward, arises from the joint impetus
of all the parts. Therefore, if surrounding bodies are moved, those that

8C THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES
mined by the translation of it from those which only seem to rest ; f or the
external bodies ought not only to appear at rest, but to be really at rest.
For otherwise, all included bodies, beside their translation from near the
surrounding ones, partake likewise of their true motions ; and though that
translation were not made they would not be really at rest, but only seem
to be so. For the surrounding bodies stand in the like relation to the
surrounded as the exterior part of a whole does to the interior, or as the
shell does to the kernel ; b ut, if the shell moves, the kernel will also
move, as being part of the whole, without any removal from near the shell.
A property, near akin to the preceding, is this, that if a place is moved,
whatever is placed therein moves along with it ; and therefore a body,
which is moved from a place in motion, partakes also of the motion of its
place. Upon which account, all motions, from places in motion, are no
other than parts of entire and absolute motions ; and every entire motion
is composed of the motion of the body out of its first place, and the
motion of this place out of its place ; and so on, until we come to some
immovable place, as in the before-mentioned example of the sailor. Where
fore, entire and absolute motions can be no otherwise determined than by
immovable places : and for that reason I did before refer those absolute
motions to immovable places, but relative ones to movable places. Now
no other places are immovable but those that, from infinity to infinity, do
all retain the same given position one to another ; and upon this account
must ever remain unmoved ; and do thereby constitute immovable space.
The causes by which true and relative motions are distinguished, one
from the other, are the forces impressed upon bodies to generate motion.
True motion is neither generated nor altered, but by some force impressed
upon the body moved : but relative motion may be generated or altered
without any force impressed upon the body. For it is sufficient only to
impress some force on other bodies with which the former is compared,
that by their giving way, that relation may be changed, in which the re
lative rest or motion of this other body did consist. Again, true motion
suffers always some change from any force impressed upon the moving
body ; b ut relative motion docs not necessarily undergo any change by such
forces. For if the same forces are likewise impressed on those other bodies,
with which the comparison is made, that the relative position may be pre
served, then that condition will be preserved in which the relative motion
consists. And therefore any relative motion may be changed when the
true motion remains unaltered, and the relative may be preserved when the
true suffers some change. Upon which accounts; true motion does by no
means consist in such relations.
The effects whicli distinguish absolute from relative motion arc, the
forces of receding from the axis of circular motion. For there are no such
forces in a circular motion purely relative, but in a true and absolute cir

the air passes ; at another time it will be another part of the same, and so.
absolutely understood, it will be perpetually mutable.
III. Place is a part of space which a body takes up, and is according to
the space, either absolute or relative. I s ay, a part of space ; n ot the situation,
nor the external surface of the body. For the places of equal solids are
always equal ; b ut their superfices, by reason of their dissimilar figures, are
often unequal. Positions properly have no quantity, nor are they so much
the places themselves, as the properties of places. The motion of the whole
is the same thing with the sum of the motions of the parts ; t hat is, t he
translation of the whole, out of its place, is the same thing with the sum
of the translations of the parts out of their places ; and therefore the place
of the whole is the same thing with the sum of the places of the parts, and
for that reason, it is internal, and in the whole body.
IV. Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute
place into another ; and relative motion, the translation from one relative
place into another. Thus in a ship under sail, the relative place of a body
is that part of the ship which the body possesses ; or that part of its cavity
which the body fills, and which therefore moves together with the ship :
and relative rest is the continuance of the body in the same part of the
ship, or of its cavity. But real, absolute rest, is the continuance of the
body in the same part of that immovable space, in which the ship itself,
its cavity, and all that it contains, is moved. Wherefore, if the earth is
really at rest, the body, which relatively rests in the ship, will really and
absolutely move with the same velocity which the ship has on the earth.
But if the earth also moves, the true and absolute motion of the body will
arise, partly from the true motion of the earth, in immovable space ; partly
from the relative motion of the ship on the earth ; and if the body moves
also relatively in the ship ; i ts true motion will arise, partly from the true
motion of the earth, in immovable space, and partly from the relative mo
tions as well of the ship on the earth, as of the body in the ship ; and from
these relative motions will arise the relative motion of the body on the
earth. As if that part of the earth, where the ship is, w as truly moved
toward the east, with a velocity of 10010 parts; while the ship itself, with
a fresh gale, and full sails, is carried towards the west, with a velocity ex
pressed by 10 of those parts ; b ut a sailor walks in the ship towards the
east, with 1 part of the said velocity ; t hen the sailor will be moved truly
in immovable space towards the east, with a velocity of 10001 parts, and
relatively on the earth towards the west, with a velocity of 9 of those parts.

equal, though they are commonly considered as equal, and used for a meas

as an equable motion, whereby time may H accurately measured. All mo

surface of the earth, where the accelerative gravity, or force productive of
gravity, in all bodies is the same, the motive gravity or the weight is as
the body : but if we should ascend to higher regions, where the accelerative
gravity is less, the weight would be equally diminished, and would always
be as the product of the body, by the accelerative gravity. So in those re
gions, where the accelerative gravity is diminished into one half, the weight
of a body two or three times less, will be four or six times less.
I likewise call attractions and impulses, in the same sense, accelerative,
and motive ; and use the words attraction, impulse or propensity of any
sort towards a centre, promiscuously, and indifferently, one for another ;
considering those forces not physically, but mathematically : wherefore, the
reader is not to imagine, that by those words, I anywhere take upon me to
define the kind, or the manner of any action, the causes or the physical
reason thereof, or that I attribute forces, in a true and physical sense, to
certain centres (which are only mathematical points) ; when at any time I
happen to speak of centres as attracting, or as endued with attractive
powers.
SCHOLIUM.
Hitherto I have laid down the definitions of such words as are less
known, and explained the sense in which I would have them to be under
stood in the following discourse. I do not define time, space, place and
motion, as being well known to all. Only I must observe, that the vulgar
conceive those quantities under no other notions but from the relation they
bear to sensible objects. And thence arise certain prejudices, for the re
moving of which, it will be convenient to distinguish them into absolute
and relative, true and apparent, mathematical and common.
I. Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own na
ture flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another
name is called duration : relative, apparent, and common time, is some sen
sible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by
the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ; such
as an hour, a day, a month, a year.
II. Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything exter
nal, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some mo
vable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces ; which our senses de
termine by its position to bodies ; and which is vulgarly taken for immo
vable space ; such is the dimension of a subterraneous, an aereal, or celestial
space, determined by its position in respect of the earth. Absolute and
relative space, are the same in figure and magnitude ; b ut they do not re
main always numerically the same. For if the earth, for instance, moves,
a space of our air, which relatively and in respect of the earth remains al
ways the same, will at one time be one part of the absolute space into which

themselves, whether that space is at rest, or moves uniformly forwards
in a right line without any circular motion.
For the differences of the motions tending towards the same parts, and
the sums of those that tend towards contrary parts, are, at first (by sup
position), in both cases the same ; and it is from those sums and differences
that the collisions and impulses do arise with which the bodies mutually
impinge one upon another. Wherefore (by Law II), the effects of those
collisions will be equal in both cases ; and therefore the mutual motions
of the bodies among themselves in the one case will remain equal to the
mutual motions of the bodies among themselves in the other. A clear
proof of which we have from the experiment of a ship ; where all motions
happen after the same manner, whether the ship is at rest, or is carried
uniformly forwards in a right line.
COROLLARY VI.
If bodies, any how moved among themselves, are urged in the direct-ton
of parallel lines by equal accelerative forces, they will all continue to
move among themselves, after the same manner as if they had been
urged by no such forces.
For these forces acting equally (with respect to the quantities of the
DO dies to be moved), and in the direction of parallel lines, will (by Law II)
move all the bodies equally (as to velocity), and therefore will never pro
duce any change in the positions or motions of the bodies among themselves.
SCHOLIUM.
Hitherto I have laid down such principles as have been received by math
ematicians, and are confirmed by abundance of experiments. By the first
two Laws and the first two Corollaries, Galileo discovered that the de
scent of bodies observed the duplicate ratio of the time, and that the mo
tion of projectiles was in the curve of a parabola; experience agreeing
with both, unless so far as these motions are a little retarded by the re
sistance of the air. When a body is falling, the uniform force of its
gravity acting equally, impresses, in equal particles of time, equal forces
upon that body, and therefore generates equal velocities; and in the whole
time impresses a whole force, and generates a whole velocity proportional
to the time. And the spaces described in proportional times are as the
velocities and the times conjunctly ; t hat is, i n a duplicate ratio of the
times. And when a body is thrown upwards, its uniform gravity im
presses forces and takes off velocities proportional to the times ; and the
times of ascending to the greatest heights are as the velocities to be taken
off, and those heights are as the velocities and the times conjunetly, or ir,
the duplicate ratio of the velocities. And if a body be projected in any

so doubtingly hovered, lived ;— lived to a vigorous maturity, to a
hale old age ;— lived to become the boast of his country, the won
der of his time, and the "ornament of his srjecies."
Beyond the grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir
Isaac cannot with certainty be traced. Two traditions were held
in the family : one, that they were of Scotch extraction ; t he
other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire,
dwelling, for a time, however, at Westby, county of Lincoln, be
fore the removal to and purchase of Woolsthorpe — about a h undred
years before this memorable birth.
The widow Newton was left with the simple means of a com
fortable subsistence. The Woolsthorpe estate together with
small one which she possessed at Sewstern, in Leicestershire, yield
ed her an income of some eighty pounds ; a nd upon this limited sum,
she had to rely chiefly for the support of herself, and the educa
tion of her child. She continued his nurture for three years,
when, marrying again, she confided the tender charge to the care
of her own mother.
Great genius is seldom marked by precocious development ;
and young Isaac, sent, at the usual age, to two day schools at
Skillington and Stoke, exhibited no unusual traits of character.
In his twelfth year, he was placed at the public school at Gran-
tham, and boarded at the house of Mr. Clark, an apothecary.
But even in this excellent seminary, his mental acquisitions con
tinued for a while unpromising enough : study apparentlv had no
charms for him ; h e was very inattentive, and ranked low in the
school. One day, however, the boy immediately above our seem
ingly dull student gave him a severe kick in the stomach ; I saac,
deeply affected, but with no outburst of passion, betook himself,
with quiet, incessant toil, to his books ; h e quickly passed above
the offending classmate ; yet there he stopped not ; the strong
spirit was, for once and forever, awakened, and, yielding to itb
noble impulse, he speedily took up his position at the head of all.
His peculiar character began now rapidly to unfold itself.
Close application grew to be habitual. Observation alternated
with reflection. " A sober, silent, thinking lad," yet, the wisest
and the kindliest, the indisputable leader of his fellows. Gener-

chiefly, in the possession of the family of the Earl of Portsmouth,
through the Viscountess Lymington.
Everything appertaining to Newton has been kept and che
rished with peculiar veneration. Different memorials of him are
preserved in Trinity College, Cambridge ; i n the rooms of the
Royal Society, of London : and in the Museum of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh.
The manor-house, at Woolsthorpe, was visited by Dr. Stuke
ley, in October, 1721, who, in a letter to Dr. Mead, written in
1727, gave the following description of it: — " 'Tis built of stone,
as is the way of the country hereabouts, and a reasonably good
one. They led me up stairs and showed me Sir Isaac's stud}-,
where I supposed he studied, when in the country, in his younger
days, or perhaps when he visited his mother from the University.
I observed the shelves were of his own making, being pieces of
deal boxes, which probably he sent his books and clothes down
in on those occasions. There were, some years ago, two or threr
hundred books in it of his father-in-law, Mr. Smith, which Sir
Isaac gave to Dr. Newton, of our town." The celebrated apple-
tree, the fall of one of the apples of which is said to have turned
the attention of Newton to the subject of gravity, was destroyed
by the wind about twenty years ago ; b ut it has been preserved
in the form of a chair. The house itself has been protected with
religious care. It was repaired in 1798, and a tablet of white
marble put up in the room where our author was born, with the

LIFE OF
SIE ISAAC NEWTON.
Nec fas est proprius mortal? attingere Divos. — HALLEY.
FROM the thick darkness of the middle ages man's struggling
spirit emerged as in new birth ; b reaking out of the iron control
of that period ; growing strong and confident in the tug and din
of succeeding conflict and revolution, it bounded forwards and
upwards with resistless vigour to the investigation of physical and
moral truth ; ascending height after height ; sweeping afar over
the earth, penetrating afar up into the heavens ; i ncreasing in en
deavour, enlarging in endowment ; every where boldly, earnestly
out-stretching, till, in the AUTHOR of the PRINCIPIA, one arose,
who, grasping the master-key of the universe and treading its
celestial paths, opened up to the human intellect the stupendous
realities of the material world, and, in the unrolling of its harmo
nies, gave to the human heart a new song to the goodness, wis
dom, and majesty of the all-creating, all-sustaining, all-perfect
God.
Sir Isaac Newton, in whom the rising intellect seemed to attain,
as it were, to its culminating point, was born on the 25th of De
cember, O. S. 1642 — Christmas day — at Woolsthorpe, in the
parish of Colsterworth, in Lincolnshire. His father, John New
ton, died at the age of thirty-six, and only a few months after his
marriage to Harriet Ayscough, daughter of James Ayscough, oi
Rutlandshire. Mrs. Newton, probably wrought upon by the
early loss of her husband, gave premature birth to her only and
posthumous child, of which, too, from its extreme diminutiveness,
she appeared likely to be soon bereft. Happily, it w as otherwise
decreed ! The tiny infant, on whose little lips the breath of life

turned. The more immediate affairs of the farm received no
better attention. In fact, his passion for study grew daily more
absorbing, and his dislike for every other occupation more in
tense. His mother, therefore, wisely resolved to give him all the
advantages which an education could confer. He was sent back
to Grantham school, where he remained for some months in busy
preparation for his academical studies. At the recommendation
of one of his uncles, who had himself studied at Trinity College,
Cambridge, Newton proceeded thither, and was duly admitted.
on the 5th day of June 1660, in the eighteenth year of his age.
The eager student had now entered upon a new and wider
field ; and we find him devoting himself to the pursuit of know

He exposed the folly of this pseudo-science by erecting a figure
with the aid of one or two of the problems of Euclid ;— and thus
began his study of the Mathematics. His researches into this
science were prosecuted with unparallelled vigour and success.
Regarding the propositions contained in Euclid as self-evident
truths, he passed rapidly over this ancient system — a step which
he afterward much regretted — and mastered, without further pre
paratory study, the Analytical Geometry of Descartes. Wallis's
Arithmetic of Infinites, Saunderson's Logic, and the Optics of
Kepler, he also studied with great care ; writing upon them
many comments ; and, in these notes on Wallis's work was un
doubtedly the germ of his fluxionary calculus. His progress was
so great that he found himself more profoundly versed than his tutor
in many branches of learning. Yet his acquisitions were not
gotten with the rapidity of intuition ; b ut they were thoroughly
made and firmly secured. Quickness of apprehension, or Intel
lectual nimbleness did not belong to him. He saw too far : his,
insight was too deep. He dwelt fully, cautiously upon the least
subject ; while to the consideration of the greatest, he brought a
massive strength joined with a matchless clearness, that, regard
less of the merely trivial or unimportant, bore with unerring sa
gacity upon the prominences of the subject, and, grappling with
its difficulties, rarely failed to surmount them.

was Sir Isaac's uncle. Before his death he made an equitable
distribution of his two other estates : the one in Berkshire to the
sons and daughter of a brother of Mrs. Conduit ; and the other,
at Kensington, to Catharine, the only daughter of Mr. Conduit,

of discovery — the stirring elements of that wondrous spirit,
which, clear, calm, and great, moved, in after years, through
deep onward through deep of Nature's mysteries, unlocking her
strongholds, dispelling darkness, educing order — everywhere si
lently conquering.
Newton had an early and decided taste for drawing. Pictures,
taken sometimes from copies, but often from life, and drawn,
coloured and framed by himself, ornamented his apartment. He
was skilled also, in poetical composition, " excelled in making
verses ;" some of these were borne in remembrance and repeated,
seventy years afterward, by Mrs. Vincent, for whom, in early
youth, as Miss Storey, he formed an ardent attachment. She
was the sister of a physician resident near Woolsthorpe ; b ut
Newton's intimate acquaintance with her began at Grantham.
where they were both numbered among the inmates of the same
house. Two or three years younger than himself, of great per
sonal beauty, and unusual talent, her society afforded him the
greatest pleasure ; and their youthful friendship, it is believed,
gradually rose to a higher passion ; b ut inadequacy of fortune
prevented their union. Miss Storey was afterwards twice mar
ried ; N ewton, never; his esteem for her continued unabated
during life, accompanied by numerous acts of attention and
kindness.
In 1656, Newton's mother was again left a widowr, and took
up her abode once more at Woolsthorpe. He was now fifteen
years of age, and had made great progress in his studies ; b ut she,
desirous of his help, and from motives of economy, recalled him
from school. Business occupations, however, and the manage
ment of the farm, proved utterly distasteful to him. When sent to
Grantham Market on Saturdays, he would betake himself to his
former lodgings in the apothecary's garret, where some of Mr.
Clark's old books employed his thoughts till the aged and trust
worthy servant had executed the family commissions and announced
the necessity of return : or, at other times, our young philosopher
would seat himself under a hedge, by the wayside, and continue
his studies till the same faithful personage — proceeding alone to
the town and completing the day's business — stopped as he re-

so doubtingly hovered, lived ;— lived to a vigorous maturity, to a
hale old age ;— lived to become the boast of his country, the won
der of his time, and the "ornament of his srjecies."
Beyond the grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir
Isaac cannot with certainty be traced. Two traditions were held
in the family : one, that they were of Scotch extraction ; t he
other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire,
dwelling, for a time, however, at Westby, county of Lincoln, be
fore the removal to and purchase of Woolsthorpe — about a h undred
years before this memorable birth.
The widow Newton was left with the simple means of a com
fortable subsistence. The Woolsthorpe estate together with
small one which she possessed at Sewstern, in Leicestershire, yield
ed her an income of some eighty pounds ; a nd upon this limited sum,
she had to rely chiefly for the support of herself, and the educa
tion of her child. She continued his nurture for three years,
when, marrying again, she confided the tender charge to the care
of her own mother.
Great genius is seldom marked by precocious development ;
and young Isaac, sent, at the usual age, to two day schools at
Skillington and Stoke, exhibited no unusual traits of character.
In his twelfth year, he was placed at the public school at Gran-
tham, and boarded at the house of Mr. Clark, an apothecary.
But even in this excellent seminary, his mental acquisitions con
tinued for a while unpromising enough : study apparentlv had no
charms for him ; h e was very inattentive, and ranked low in the
school. One day, however, the boy immediately above our seem
ingly dull student gave him a severe kick in the stomach ; I saac,
deeply affected, but with no outburst of passion, betook himself,
with quiet, incessant toil, to his books ; h e quickly passed above
the offending classmate ; yet there he stopped not ; the strong
spirit was, for once and forever, awakened, and, yielding to itb
noble impulse, he speedily took up his position at the head of all.
His peculiar character began now rapidly to unfold itself.
Close application grew to be habitual. Observation alternated
with reflection. " A sober, silent, thinking lad," yet, the wisest
and the kindliest, the indisputable leader of his fellows. Gener-

chiefly, in the possession of the family of the Earl of Portsmouth,
through the Viscountess Lymington.
Everything appertaining to Newton has been kept and che
rished with peculiar veneration. Different memorials of him are
preserved in Trinity College, Cambridge ; i n the rooms of the
Royal Society, of London : and in the Museum of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh.
The manor-house, at Woolsthorpe, was visited by Dr. Stuke
ley, in October, 1721, who, in a letter to Dr. Mead, written in
1727, gave the following description of it: — " 'Tis built of stone,
as is the way of the country hereabouts, and a reasonably good
one. They led me up stairs and showed me Sir Isaac's stud}-,
where I supposed he studied, when in the country, in his younger
days, or perhaps when he visited his mother from the University.
I observed the shelves were of his own making, being pieces of
deal boxes, which probably he sent his books and clothes down
in on those occasions. There were, some years ago, two or threr
hundred books in it of his father-in-law, Mr. Smith, which Sir
Isaac gave to Dr. Newton, of our town." The celebrated apple-
tree, the fall of one of the apples of which is said to have turned
the attention of Newton to the subject of gravity, was destroyed
by the wind about twenty years ago ; b ut it has been preserved
in the form of a chair. The house itself has been protected with
religious care. It was repaired in 1798, and a tablet of white
marble put up in the room where our author was born, with the
follow, ng inscription :—
" Sir Isaac Newton, son of John Newton, Lord of the Manor
of Woolsthorpe, was born in this room, on the 25th of December,
1642."

It will be borne in mind that all of Newton's theological wri
tings, with the exception of the Letters to Dr. Bentley, were
composed before this event which, we must conclude, from
Pryme's words, produced a serious impression upon our author for
about a month. But M. Biot, in his Life of Newton, relying on a
memorandum contained in a small manuscript Journal of Huygens,
declares this occurrence to have caused a deran-gement of New
ton's intellect. M. Blot's opinions and deductions, however, as
well as those of La Place, upon this subject, were based upon
erroneous data, and have been overthrown by the clearest proof.
There is not, in fact, the least evidence that Newton's reason was,
for a single moment, dethroned ; on the contrary, the testimony
is conclusive that he was, at all times, perfectly capable of carry
ing on his mathematical, metaphysical and astronomical inquiries.
Loss of sleep, loss of appetite, and irritated nerves will disturb
somewhat the equanimity of the most serene ; and an act done, or
language employed, under such temporary discomposure, is not a
just criterion of the general tone and strength of a man's mind.
As to the accident itself, we may suppose, whatever might have
been its precise nature, that it greatly distressed him, and, still
further, that its shock may have originated the train of nervous
derangements, which afflicted him, more or less, for two years
afterward. Yet, during this very period of ill health, we find him
putting forth his highest powers. In 1692, he prepared for, and
transmitted to Dr. Wallis the first proposition of the Treatise on
Quadratures, with examples of it in first, second and third flux
ions. He investigated, in the same year, the subject of haloes ;
making and recording numerous and important observations rela
tive thereto. Those profound and beautiful Letters to Dr. Bentley
were written at the close of this and the beginning of the next
year. In October, 1693, Locke, who was then about publishing a
second edition of his work on the Human Understanding, request
ed Newton to reconsider his opinions on innate ideas. And in
1694, he was zealously occupied in perfecting his lunar theory ;
visiting Flamstead, at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, in
September, and obtaining a series of lunar observations ; and

    {
      "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
      "answer": "Newton defines “quantity of motion” (what we now call momentum) as the measure that arises from a body’s **quantity of matter (its mass) together with its velocity**. In his own words (Definition II): “The quantity of motion is the measure of the same, arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly.” Thus a body twice as massive with the same speed has twice the quantity of motion; a body moving twice as fast has four‑times the quantity of motion.\n\n“Force,” by contrast, is not a property of the moving body but the **cause that changes that quantity of motion**. Newton distinguishes several kinds of force (absolute, accelerative, motive) and states (Law II) that “the alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed.” In other words, force is the agent that produces or modifies the quantity of motion, whereas the quantity of motion itself is the product of mass and velocity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?",
      "answer": "Newton derives Kepler’s second law by applying his second law of motion to a body that is acted on only by a **central (centripetal) force**.  \n\n1. **Law II (F = ma)** tells us that the force on a body is proportional to its acceleration.  \n2. **Corollary VI** (and the accompanying scholium) shows that when the force is always directed toward the centre of motion it has two components:  \n   * a component **along the radius** (which changes the speed of the body), and  \n   * a component **perpendicular to the radius** (which only changes the direction of the velocity).  \n\n3. Because the force is **central**, the perpendicular component produces no torque about the centre; therefore the **angular momentum** of the body about the centre is constant.  \n\n4. Constant angular momentum means that the **areal velocity** (the area swept out by the radius vector per unit time) is constant:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{dA}{dt}= \\frac{1}{2} r^{2}\\,\\dot\\theta = \\text{constant}\n\\]\n\n5. Since the areal velocity is constant, the radius vector sweeps **equal areas in equal times**.  \n\nThus, from his laws of motion and the fact that the gravitational force is a central force, Newton proves that any body moving under gravity (or any central force) describes equal areas in equal times—exactly Kepler’s second law."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?",
      "answer": "Newton shows the inverse‑square law by treating each body as a collection of infinitesimal parts whose individual attractions obey the reciprocal‑square law, then proving that the sum of all those partial attractions also obeys the same law.  \n\n1. **Decomposition into parts** – He first notes that the gravitational force exerted by a whole planet on a body is the compound of the forces exerted by each of its constituent parts, and that each partial force is “reciprocally proportional to the squares of the distances from the part” (Prop. VIII, Theorem VIII).  \n\n2. **Summation of the partial forces** – Using Propositions LXXV and LXXVI (and their corollaries) he shows that when all these partial forces are summed, the resulting total force retains the same proportionality: the total force on a sphere is proportional to the product of the masses and **inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two centres**.  \n\n3. **Common centre of gravity** – He then argues that the mutual attraction of two bodies can be regarded as if each were attracted toward the common centre of gravity (the midpoint for equal masses). Since the law of attraction is the same with respect to the distance between the bodies and the distance to the common centre, the same inverse‑square dependence holds for the mutual force.  \n\nThus, by decomposing the bodies, summing the inverse‑square contributions of all parts, and invoking the symmetry of the common centre of gravity, Newton demonstrates that the gravitational attraction between two masses varies **inversely as the square of the distance between their centres**."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?",
      "answer": "Newton argues that gravity must act on all masses because the gravitational force is proportional to the quantity of matter in a body, and every part of a body attracts every other part. By the law of action‑and‑reaction, each part of one body exerts a force on each part of another, so the total force between two bodies is the sum of the forces between all their parts. Since the force on each part is proportional to its mass and follows the same inverse‑square law, the resulting attraction is universal: every mass, however small, both produces and experiences the same gravitational force, the only difference being that the force on tiny bodies is so small that it is not perceptible. This reasoning shows that gravitational attraction is a universal, mass‑proportional, inverse‑square force that acts on all masses."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?",
      "answer": "Newton explains that the orbits of the planets are not perfect ellipses because each planet is also attracted by the other planets.  The mutual gravitational attractions act in different directions and with different strengths, so the accelerative force on any one planet is not exactly the same as on the others.  When the forces are unequal (i.e., when the attractions are not exactly proportional to the inverse‑square of the distances or when the masses and distances differ), the resulting “difference of the forces” produces a perturbation of the orbit.  This perturbation appears as a change in longitude (a shift along the orbit) and also as a change in latitude (a tilt out of the orbital plane).  The magnitude of the perturbation is proportional to the magnitude of the disturbing force—e.g., the difference between the Sun’s and Jupiter’s attractions on Saturn, or the influence of Jupiter and Saturn on each other—so the larger the masses and the closer the distances, the larger the perturbation.  For the inner planets the perturbations are very small because their masses are small, while the perturbations of the larger outer planets (especially Jupiter and Saturn) are more noticeable.  In short, Newton attributes planetary perturbations to the unequal, non‑parallel gravitational forces that the planets exert on one another, which modify the ideal elliptical motion."

      "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation",
      "answer": "Newton’s “Principia” was built on the same ideas that later became calculus, but he expressed them in the geometric language of his time.  In the work he used:\n\n* **Fluxions and fluents** – the quantities Newton called “fluxions” (the instantaneous rates of change) and the “fluents” (the quantities that flow).  He derived them by treating curves, surfaces and solids as being generated by the continuous motion of points, lines and surfaces, and he obtained their velocities by the rules of infinite series.  This is essentially the differential‑integral method that later became calculus.\n\n* **Geometric synthesis** – Newton preferred to develop the results by pure geometry (the “geometrical method”) rather than by algebraic manipulation, following his own conviction that the geometric method was the proper way to train the mind.\n\n* **Binomial theorem and infinite series** – he applied his binomial theorem and infinite‑series expansions to the rectification of curves, the determination of areas, volumes and centres of gravity, which are the analytic tools that underlie integral calculus.\n\nNewton did not use the modern “calculus notation” (the “d‑notation” of Leibniz, the dot‑notation for derivatives, etc.) for two reasons given in the text:\n\n1. **Preference for the geometric method** – Newton believed that geometry was the proper vehicle for developing mathematical thought and that algebraic calculations were a “censured” handling of geometric subjects.  His authority and taste led him to present his results in a purely geometric form.\n\n2. **Notation had not yet been published** – the algorithmic notation for fluxions did not appear until it was printed in Wallis’s work in 1693, well after the “Principia” was completed.  Consequently, Newton’s work remained in the geometric‑fluxion language rather than the later standard calculus symbols."

      "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
      "answer": "Newton explains orbital motion by asserting that any body that moves in a curved path is continually acted on by a **centripetal force** directed toward a fixed centre of force. This inward‑directed force supplies the acceleration needed to keep the body from moving in a straight line and to keep it on its orbit. In the case of a circular orbit the centripetal force is exactly the gravitational attraction of the central body, and its magnitude is proportional to the square of the body’s velocity and inversely proportional to the radius of the orbit (or, equivalently, proportional to the square of the distance from the centre when expressed as a force law). Newton shows that, because the centripetal force is the same at equal distances from the centre, the velocities of bodies at equal altitudes are equal, and the acceleration produced by the centripetal force is the same for bodies moving along adjacent circular arcs. By relating the centripetal force to the known force of gravity (through the descent of heavy bodies and the law of periods), Newton demonstrates that the gravitational force of the Earth (or any central body) is the centripetal force that keeps moons, planets, and other bodies in their orbital motions."

      "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
      "answer": "Newton treats a resisting medium by adding a resistive force to the ordinary equations of motion. In his analysis the resistance of a fluid is split into three parts:  \n\n* a part that depends on the **density** of the fluid and is proportional to the **square of the velocity** (a “duplicate‑ratio” of the velocity);  \n* a part that depends on the **tenacity (viscous tenacity)** of the fluid and is **uniform** (or proportional to the “moment of time”);  \n* a part that is proportional to the **velocity itself** (the “ratio of the velocity”).  \n\nIn the propositions of Book II Newton shows that the motion of a body in such a medium can be treated by adding this resistance to the body’s weight when the body moves upward (so the net force is gravity + uniform resistance) and subtracting it when the body moves downward (gravity – uniform resistance). The same method can be extended to cases where the resistance is partly uniform, partly proportional to the velocity, and partly proportional to the square of the velocity, as indicated in the Scholium and the corollaries to Propositions VIII, IX, XIII and XIV. Thus Newton handles motion in resisting media by incorporating appropriate resistance terms (uniform, linear, and quadratic) into the force balance governing the body's motion."

    {
      "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
      "answer": "Newton treats **time and space as “absolute”** – they exist in their own nature, unaltered by anything external.  Absolute time (duration) flows uniformly, and absolute space is a fixed, immovable framework.  **Relative motion** is only the change of position measured with respect to other bodies or to a “movable” reference; it is an apparent, sensible measure that can change without any force acting on the body itself.\n\nIn Newton’s view **absolute motion** is the translation of a body from one absolute place to another, and it is detectable by the **real forces** it produces (e.g., the centrifugal forces that appear only in true circular motion).  By contrast, **relative motion** can be altered simply by moving the reference body; it need not involve any force on the object whose motion is being described.\n\nThis distinction underpins Newton’s laws:\n\n* **Law I (inertia)** and **Law II (force = mass × acceleration)** are formulated with respect to the immutable absolute space and time; only in this fixed frame does a body’s change of motion (acceleration) correspond uniquely to the forces impressed on it.  \n* Because absolute space provides an immutable reference, the **effects that distinguish absolute from relative motion** (such as the outward‑directed “receding” force in true circular motion) can be identified, allowing the laws to predict true motions regardless of any relative motion of the observer or of other bodies.  \n\nThus, Newton’s notion of absolute space‑time supplies the objective frame in which his laws are valid, while relative motion is merely a convenient, but non‑fundamental, description of motion relative to other bodies."

Therefore, upon the meeting of the bodies, if A acquire 3, 4,\nor 5 parts of motion, B will lose as many ; and therefore after reflexion\nA will proceed With 9, 10, or 11 parts, and B with 7, 6, or 5 parts; the\nsum remaining always of 16 parts as before.

The power of magnetism in one and the same body may be\nincreased and diminished ; and is sometimes far stronger, for the quantity\nof matter, than the power of gravity ; and in receding from the magnet\ndecreases not in the duplicate but almost in the triplicate proportion of the\ndistance, as nearly as I could judge from some rude observations.\nPROPOSITION VII. THEOREM VII.\nThat there is a power of gravity tending to all bodies, proportional to\nthe several quantities of matter which they contain.\nThat all the planets mutually gravitate one towards another, we have\nproved before ; a s well as that the force of gravity towards every one of them,\nconsidered apart, is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from\nthe centre of the planet. And thence (by Prop. LXIX, Book I, a nd its\nCorollaries) it follows, that the gravity tending towards all the planets is\nproportional to the matter which they contain.\nMoreover, since all the parts of any planet A gravitate towards any\nother planet B ; and the gravity of every part is to the gravity of the\nwhole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole ; and (by Law\nIII) to every action corresponds an equal re-action ; t herefore the planet B\nwill, on the other hand, gravitate towards all the parts of the planet A ;\nand its gravity towards any one part will be to the gravity towards the\nwhole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole. Q.E.D.\nCOR, 1. Therefore the force of gravity towards any whole planet arises\nfrom, and is compounded of, the forces of gravity towards all its parts.\nMagnetic and electric attractions afford us examples of this ; f or all at\ntraction towards the whole arises from the attractions towards the several\nparts. The thing may be easily understood in gravity, if we consider a\ngreater planet, as formed of a number of lesser planets, meeting together in\none globe ; f or hence it would appear that the force of the whole must\narise from the forces of the component parts. If it is objected, that, ac\ncording to this law, all bodies with us must mutually gravitate one to\nwards another, whereas no such gravitation any where appears, I answer,\nthat since the gravitation towards these bodies is to the gravitation towards\nthe whole earth as these bodies are to the whole earth, the gravitation to\nwards them must be far less than to fall under the observation of our senses.\nCOR. 2. The force of gravity towards the several equal particles of any\nbody is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from the parti\ncles ; as appears from Cor. 3, Prop. LXXIV, Book I."

In forming this conclusion, he supposed the\nplanets to move in perfect circles, concentric to the sun. Now\nwas this the law of the moon's motion ? Was such a force, em\nanating from the earth and directed to the moon, sufficient, when\ndiminished as the square of the distance, to retain her in her\norbit ?

And\nthis perturbation, added to the perturbation arising from the inequality\nand inclination of the lines, makes the whole perturbation greater.\nCOR. '*. Hence if the parts of this system move in ellipses or circles\nwithout any remarkable perturbation, it is manifest that, if they are at all\nimpelled by accelerative forces tending to any other bodies, the impulse is\nvery weak, or else is impressed very near equally and in parallel directions\nupon all of them.\nPROPOSITION LXVL THEOREM XXVI.\nTf three bodies whose forces decrease in a duplicate ratio of the distances\nattract each other mutually ; and the accelerative attractions of any\ntwo towards the third be between themselves reciprocally as the squares,\nof the distances ; and the two least revolve about the greatest ; I say,\nthat the interior of the tivo revolving bodies will, by radii drawn to the\ninnermost and greatest, describe round thai body areas more propor\ntional to the times, and a f igure more approaching to that of an ellip\nsis having its focus in the point of concourse of the radii, if t hat great\nbody be agitated by those attractions, than it would do if lhat great\nbody were not attracted at all by the lesser, but remained at rest ; or\nthan it would if that great body were very much more or very much\nless attracted, <>r very much more or very much less agitated, by the\nattractions.\nThis appears plainly enough from the demonstration of the second\nCorollary of tl.e foregoing Proposition; but it may be made out after\nthis manner by a way of reasoning more distinct and more universally\nconvincing.\nCASE 1.

LXVII, Book I), a nd therefore that\nerror, when it is greatest, scarcely exceeds two minutes ; and the greatest\nerror in the mean motion scarcely exceeds two minutes yearly.

But the greatest power of Saturn\nto disturb the motion of Jupiter is proportional to this difference; and\ntherefore the perturbation of the orbit of Jupiter is much less than that of\nSaturn's. The perturbations of the other orbits are yet far less, except that\nthe orbit of the earth is sensibly disturbed by the moon.

In any circle suppose a polygon to be inscribed of any number\nof sides. And if a body, moved with a given velocity along the sides of the\npolygon, is reflected from the circle at the several angular points, the force,\nwith which at every reflection it strikes the circle, will be as its velocity :\nand therefore the sum of the forces, in a given time, will be as that ve\nlocity and the number of reflections conjunctly ; t hat is (if the species of\nthe polygon be given), as the length described in that given time, and in\ncreased or diminished in the ratio of the same length to the radius of the\ncircle ; t hat is, a s the square of that length applied to the radius ; and\ntherefore the polygon, by having its sides diminished in'inftnitum, coin\ncides with the circle, as the square of the arc described in a given time ap\nplied to the radius. This is the centrifugal force, with which the body\nimpels the circle ; and to which the contrary force, wherewith the circle\ncontinually repels the body towards the centre, is equal.\nPROPOSITION V.

IV) is in a ratio compounded of the sim\nple ratio of the radius TP directly, and the duplicate ratio of the periodi\ncal time inversely ; i t is plain that this compounded ratio is diminished by\nthe action of the force KL ; a nd therefore that the periodical time, supposing\nthe radius of the orbit PT to remain the same, will be increased, and that\nin the subduplicate of that ratio in which the centripetal force is diminish\ned ; and, therefore, supposing this radius increased or diminished, the peri\nodical time will be increased more or diminished less than in the sesquipli-\ncate ratio of this radius, by Cor. 6, Prop.

Therefore if the action of the distant\nbody S, by which that force is diminished, were to increase and decrease\nby turns, the radius TP will be also increased and diminshed by turns ;\nand the periodical time will be increased and diminished in a ratio com\npounded of the sesquiplicate ratio of the radius, and of the subduplicate oi\nthat ratio in which the centripetal force of the central body T is dimin\nished or increased, by the increase or decrease of the action of the distant\nbody S.\nCOR. 7.

But it is suf\nficient to have cleared the way to this speculation in Prop. VIII and IX\nforegoing, and their Corollaries. For in those Propositions, instead of the\nuniform resistance made to an ascending body arising from its gravity,\none may substitute the uniform resistance which arises from the tenacity\nof the medium, when the body moves by its vis insita alone ; and when the\nbody ascends in a right line, add this uniform resistance to the force of\ngravity, and subduct it when the body descends in a right line. One\nmight also go on to the motion of bodies which are resisted in part uni\nformly, in part in the ratio of the velocity, and in part in the duplicate\nratio of the same velocity. And I have opened a way to this in Prop.\nXIII and XIV foregoing, in which the uniform resistance arising from the\ntenacity of the medium may be substituted for the force of gravity, or be\ncompounded with it as before. But I hasten to other things."

The duration or perseverance of the\nexistence of things remains the same, whether the motions are swift or slow,\nor none at all : and therefore it ought to be distinguished from what are\nonly sensible measures thereof ; and out of which we collect it, b y means\nof the astronomical equation. The necessity of which equation, for deter\nmining the times of a phamomenon, is evinced as well from the experiments\nof the pendulum clock, as by eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter.\nAs the order of the parts of time is immutable, so also is the order of\nthe parts of space. Suppose those parts to be moved out of their places, and\nthey will be moved (if the expression may be allowed) out of themselves.\nFor times and spaces are, as it were, the places as well of themselves as of\nall other things. All things are placed in time as to order of succession ;\nand in space as _to order of situation. It is from their essence or nature\nthat they are places ; and that the primary places of things should be\nmoveable, is absurd. These are therefore the absolute places ; and trans\nlations out of those places, are the only absolute motions.\nBut because the parts of space cannot be seen, or distinguished from one\nanother by our senses, therefore in their stead we use sensible measures of\nthem. For from the positions and distances of things from any body con\nsidered as immovable, we define all places ; and then with respect to such\nplaces, we estimate all motions, considering bodies as transferred from some\nof those places into others. And'so, instead of absolute places and motions,\nwe use relative ones; and that without any inconvenience in common af\nfairs ; b ut in philosophical disquisitions, we ought to abstract from our\nsenses, and consider things themselves, distinct from what are only sensible\nmeasures of them. For it may be that there is no body really at rest, to\nwhich the places and motions of others may be referred.\nBut we may distinguish rest and motion, absolute and relative, one from\nthe other by their properties, causes and effects. It is a property of rest,\nthat bodies really at rest do rest in respect to one another. And therefore\nas it is possible, that in the remote regions of the fixed stars, or perhaps\nfar beyond them, there may be some body absolutely at rest ; b ut impossi\nble to know, from the position of bodies to one another in our regions\nwhether any of these do keep the same position to that remote body; it\nfollows that absolute rest cannot be determined from the position of bodies\nin our regions.\nIt is a property of motion, that the parts, which retain given positions\nto their wholes, do partake of the motions of those wholes. For all the\nparts of revolving bodies endeavour to recede from the axis of motion ;\nand the impetus of bodies moving forward, arises from the joint impetus\nof all the parts.

For the surrounding bodies stand in the like relation to the\nsurrounded as the exterior part of a whole does to the interior, or as the\nshell does to the kernel ; b ut, if the shell moves, the kernel will also\nmove, as being part of the whole, without any removal from near the shell.\nA property, near akin to the preceding, is this, that if a place is moved,\nwhatever is placed therein moves along with it ; and therefore a body,\nwhich is moved from a place in motion, partakes also of the motion of its\nplace. Upon which account, all motions, from places in motion, are no\nother than parts of entire and absolute motions ; and every entire motion\nis composed of the motion of the body out of its first place, and the\nmotion of this place out of its place ; and so on, until we come to some\nimmovable place, as in the before-mentioned example of the sailor. Where\nfore, entire and absolute motions can be no otherwise determined than by\nimmovable places : and for that reason I did before refer those absolute\nmotions to immovable places, but relative ones to movable places. Now\nno other places are immovable but those that, from infinity to infinity, do\nall retain the same given position one to another ; and upon this account\nmust ever remain unmoved ; and do thereby constitute immovable space.\nThe causes by which true and relative motions are distinguished, one\nfrom the other, are the forces impressed upon bodies to generate motion.\nTrue motion is neither generated nor altered, but by some force impressed\nupon the body moved : but relative motion may be generated or altered\nwithout any force impressed upon the body. For it is sufficient only to\nimpress some force on other bodies with which the former is compared,\nthat by their giving way, that relation may be changed, in which the re\nlative rest or motion of this other body did consist. Again, true motion\nsuffers always some change from any force impressed upon the moving\nbody ; b ut relative motion docs not necessarily undergo any change by such\nforces. For if the same forces are likewise impressed on those other bodies,\nwith which the comparison is made, that the relative position may be pre\nserved, then that condition will be preserved in which the relative motion\nconsists. And therefore any relative motion may be changed when the\ntrue motion remains unaltered, and the relative may be preserved when the\ntrue suffers some change. Upon which accounts; true motion does by no\nmeans consist in such relations.\nThe effects whicli distinguish absolute from relative motion arc, the\nforces of receding from the axis of circular motion.

Place is a part of space which a body takes up, and is according to\nthe space, either absolute or relative. I s ay, a part of space ; n ot the situation,\nnor the external surface of the body. For the places of equal solids are\nalways equal ; b ut their superfices, by reason of their dissimilar figures, are\noften unequal. Positions properly have no quantity, nor are they so much\nthe places themselves, as the properties of places. The motion of the whole\nis the same thing with the sum of the motions of the parts ; t hat is, t he\ntranslation of the whole, out of its place, is the same thing with the sum\nof the translations of the parts out of their places ; and therefore the place\nof the whole is the same thing with the sum of the places of the parts, and\nfor that reason, it is internal, and in the whole body.\nIV. Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute\nplace into another ; and relative motion, the translation from one relative\nplace into another. Thus in a ship under sail, the relative place of a body\nis that part of the ship which the body possesses ; or that part of its cavity\nwhich the body fills, and which therefore moves together with the ship :\nand relative rest is the continuance of the body in the same part of the\nship, or of its cavity. But real, absolute rest, is the continuance of the\nbody in the same part of that immovable space, in which the ship itself,\nits cavity, and all that it contains, is moved. Wherefore, if the earth is\nreally at rest, the body, which relatively rests in the ship, will really and\nabsolutely move with the same velocity which the ship has on the earth.\nBut if the earth also moves, the true and absolute motion of the body will\narise, partly from the true motion of the earth, in immovable space ; partly\nfrom the relative motion of the ship on the earth ; and if the body moves\nalso relatively in the ship ; i ts true motion will arise, partly from the true\nmotion of the earth, in immovable space, and partly from the relative mo\ntions as well of the ship on the earth, as of the body in the ship ; and from\nthese relative motions will arise the relative motion of the body on the\nearth. As if that part of the earth, where the ship is, w as truly moved\ntoward the east, with a velocity of 10010 parts; while the ship itself, with\na fresh gale, and full sails, is carried towards the west, with a velocity ex\npressed by 10 of those parts ; b ut a sailor walks in the ship towards the\neast, with 1 part of the said velocity ; t hen the sailor will be moved truly\nin immovable space towards the east, with a velocity of 10001 parts, and\nrelatively on the earth towards the west, with a velocity of 9 of those parts."

So in those re\ngions, where the accelerative gravity is diminished into one half, the weight\nof a body two or three times less, will be four or six times less.\nI likewise call attractions and impulses, in the same sense, accelerative,\nand motive ; and use the words attraction, impulse or propensity of any\nsort towards a centre, promiscuously, and indifferently, one for another ;\nconsidering those forces not physically, but mathematically : wherefore, the\nreader is not to imagine, that by those words, I anywhere take upon me to\ndefine the kind, or the manner of any action, the causes or the physical\nreason thereof, or that I attribute forces, in a true and physical sense, to\ncertain centres (which are only mathematical points) ; when at any time I\nhappen to speak of centres as attracting, or as endued with attractive\npowers.\nSCHOLIUM.\nHitherto I have laid down the definitions of such words as are less\nknown, and explained the sense in which I would have them to be under\nstood in the following discourse. I do not define time, space, place and\nmotion, as being well known to all. Only I must observe, that the vulgar\nconceive those quantities under no other notions but from the relation they\nbear to sensible objects. And thence arise certain prejudices, for the re\nmoving of which, it will be convenient to distinguish them into absolute\nand relative, true and apparent, mathematical and common.\nI. Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own na\nture flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another\nname is called duration : relative, apparent, and common time, is some sen\nsible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by\nthe means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ; such\nas an hour, a day, a month, a year.\nII. Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything exter\nnal, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some mo\nvable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces ; which our senses de\ntermine by its position to bodies ; and which is vulgarly taken for immo\nvable space ; such is the dimension of a subterraneous, an aereal, or celestial\nspace, determined by its position in respect of the earth.

Wherefore (by Law II), the effects of those\ncollisions will be equal in both cases ; and therefore the mutual motions\nof the bodies among themselves in the one case will remain equal to the\nmutual motions of the bodies among themselves in the other. A clear\nproof of which we have from the experiment of a ship ; where all motions\nhappen after the same manner, whether the ship is at rest, or is carried\nuniformly forwards in a right line.\nCOROLLARY VI.\nIf bodies, any how moved among themselves, are urged in the direct-ton\nof parallel lines by equal accelerative forces, they will all continue to\nmove among themselves, after the same manner as if they had been\nurged by no such forces.\nFor these forces acting equally (with respect to the quantities of the\nDO dies to be moved), and in the direction of parallel lines, will (by Law II)\nmove all the bodies equally (as to velocity), and therefore will never pro\nduce any change in the positions or motions of the bodies among themselves.\nSCHOLIUM.\nHitherto I have laid down such principles as have been received by math\nematicians, and are confirmed by abundance of experiments. By the first\ntwo Laws and the first two Corollaries, Galileo discovered that the de\nscent of bodies observed the duplicate ratio of the time, and that the mo\ntion of projectiles was in the curve of a parabola; experience agreeing\nwith both, unless so far as these motions are a little retarded by the re\nsistance of the air. When a body is falling, the uniform force of its\ngravity acting equally, impresses, in equal particles of time, equal forces\nupon that body, and therefore generates equal velocities; and in the whole\ntime impresses a whole force, and generates a whole velocity proportional\nto the time. And the spaces described in proportional times are as the\nvelocities and the times conjunctly ; t hat is, i n a duplicate ratio of the\ntimes. And when a body is thrown upwards, its uniform gravity im\npresses forces and takes off velocities proportional to the times ; and the\ntimes of ascending to the greatest heights are as the velocities to be taken\noff, and those heights are as the velocities and the times conjunetly, or ir,\nthe duplicate ratio of the velocities.

Pictures,\ntaken sometimes from copies, but often from life, and drawn,\ncoloured and framed by himself, ornamented his apartment. He\nwas skilled also, in poetical composition, \" excelled in making\nverses ;\" some of these were borne in remembrance and repeated,\nseventy years afterward, by Mrs. Vincent, for whom, in early\nyouth, as Miss Storey, he formed an ardent attachment.

Two or three years younger than himself, of great per\nsonal beauty, and unusual talent, her society afforded him the\ngreatest pleasure ; and their youthful friendship, it is believed,\ngradually rose to a higher passion ; b ut inadequacy of fortune\nprevented their union.

Two traditions were held\nin the family : one, that they were of Scotch extraction ; t he\nother, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire,\ndwelling, for a time, however, at Westby, county of Lincoln, be\nfore the removal to and purchase of Woolsthorpe — about a h undred\nyears before this memorable birth.\nThe widow Newton was left with the simple means of a com\nfortable subsistence. The Woolsthorpe estate together with\nsmall one which she possessed at Sewstern, in Leicestershire, yield\ned her an income of some eighty pounds ; a nd upon this limited sum,\nshe had to rely chiefly for the support of herself, and the educa\ntion of her child. She continued his nurture for three years,\nwhen, marrying again, she confided the tender charge to the care\nof her own mother.\nGreat genius is seldom marked by precocious development ;\nand young Isaac, sent, at the usual age, to two day schools at\nSkillington and Stoke, exhibited no unusual traits of character.\nIn his twelfth year, he was placed at the public school at Gran-\ntham, and boarded at the house of Mr. Clark, an apothecary.\nBut even in this excellent seminary, his mental acquisitions con\ntinued for a while unpromising enough : study apparentlv had no\ncharms for him ; h e was very inattentive, and ranked low in the\nschool. One day, however, the boy immediately above our seem\ningly dull student gave him a severe kick in the stomach ; I saac,\ndeeply affected, but with no outburst of passion, betook himself,\nwith quiet, incessant toil, to his books ; h e quickly passed above\nthe offending classmate ; yet there he stopped not ; the strong\nspirit was, for once and forever, awakened, and, yielding to itb\nnoble impulse, he speedily took up his position at the head of all.\nHis peculiar character began now rapidly to unfold itself.\nClose application grew to be habitual. Observation alternated\nwith reflection. \" A sober, silent, thinking lad,\" yet, the wisest\nand the kindliest, the indisputable leader of his fellows. Gener-"

But M. Biot, in his Life of Newton, relying on a\nmemorandum contained in a small manuscript Journal of Huygens,\ndeclares this occurrence to have caused a deran-gement of New\nton's intellect. M. Blot's opinions and deductions, however, as\nwell as those of La Place, upon this subject, were based upon\nerroneous data, and have been overthrown by the clearest proof.\nThere is not, in fact, the least evidence that Newton's reason was,\nfor a single moment, dethroned ; on the contrary, the testimony\nis conclusive that he was, at all times, perfectly capable of carry\ning on his mathematical, metaphysical and astronomical inquiries.\nLoss of sleep, loss of appetite, and irritated nerves will disturb\nsomewhat the equanimity of the most serene ; and an act done, or\nlanguage employed, under such temporary discomposure, is not a\njust criterion of the general tone and strength of a man's mind.\nAs to the accident itself, we may suppose, whatever might have\nbeen its precise nature, that it greatly distressed him, and, still\nfurther, that its shock may have originated the train of nervous\nderangements, which afflicted him, more or less, for two years\nafterward. Yet, during this very period of ill health, we find him\nputting forth his highest powers. In 1692, he prepared for, and\ntransmitted to Dr. Wallis the first proposition of the Treatise on\nQuadratures, with examples of it in first, second and third flux\nions. He investigated, in the same year, the subject of haloes ;\nmaking and recording numerous and important observations rela\ntive thereto. Those profound and beautiful Letters to Dr. Bentley\nwere written at the close of this and the beginning of the next\nyear. In October, 1693, Locke, who was then about publishing a\nsecond edition of his work on the Human Understanding, request\ned Newton to reconsider his opinions on innate ideas. And in\n1694, he was zealously occupied in perfecting his lunar theory ;\nvisiting Flamstead, at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, in\nSeptember, and obtaining a series of lunar observations ; and"
