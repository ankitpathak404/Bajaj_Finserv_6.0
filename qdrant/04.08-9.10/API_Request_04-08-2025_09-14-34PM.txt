RESPONSES GENERATED:
------------------------------
Q1: What is the ideal spark plug gap recommeded
A1: The ideal spark plug gap recommended is 0.8-0.9 mm.
--------------------------------------------------
Q2: Does this comes in tubeless tyre version
A2: Yes, the tubeless tyre version is available for this vehicle, as mentioned in the specifications section: "80/100-18 47P (Tubeless tyre)" and "90/90-18 51P (Tubeless tyre)".
--------------------------------------------------
Q3: Is it compulsoury to have a disc brake
A3: No, it is not compulsory to have a disc brake. The document mentions both disc and drum variants for brakes. However, it does emphasize the importance of proper brake maintenance and inspections, regardless of the type of brake used.
--------------------------------------------------
Q4: Can I put thums up instead of oil
A4: You can't put thums up instead of oil. The document recommends using the specified oil grade, such as SAE 10W 30 SL Grade (JASO MA2), to ensure proper engine performance and service life.
--------------------------------------------------
Q5: Give me JS code to generate a random number between 1 and 100
A5: To generate a random number between 1 and 100 in JavaScript, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
console.log(randomNumber);
```

This code uses the `Math.random()` function to generate a random number between 0 and 1, then multiplies it by 100 to get a number between 0 and 100, and finally adds 1 to get a number between 1 and 100. The `Math.floor()` function is used to round down the number to the nearest whole number.
