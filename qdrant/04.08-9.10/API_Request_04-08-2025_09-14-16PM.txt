RESPONSES GENERATED:
------------------------------
Q1: When will my root canal claim of Rs 25,000 be settled?
A1: Based on the provided document, it seems that your claim will be settled within 15 days from the date of receipt of the last necessary document. However, if an investigation is required, it may take up to 45 days, and if there's a delay beyond that, you'll be liable to pay interest at a rate 2% above the bank rate. 

To get an exact timeline for your claim, I recommend checking with the National Insurance Company or the TPA handling your claim.
--------------------------------------------------
Q2: I have done an IVF for Rs 56,000. Is it covered?
A2: Based on the provided policy document, IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) treatment is not explicitly mentioned as a covered procedure. However, the document does mention "Modern Treatment" which includes various procedures, but IVF is not listed. It's best to check with the insurance company directly for clarification on this specific treatment.
--------------------------------------------------
Q3: I did a cataract treatment of Rs 100,000. Will you settle the full Rs 100,000?
A3: Based on the policy document, the cataract treatment limit is up to 25% of the Sum Insured or Rs. 40,000 per eye, whichever is lower. Since you've already incurred a treatment cost of Rs 100,000, the insurance company will only cover up to the specified limit, which is either 25% of the Sum Insured or Rs. 40,000 per eye.
--------------------------------------------------
Q4: Give me a list of documents to be uploaded for hospitalization for heart surgery.
A4: Based on the provided context, the documents to be uploaded for hospitalization for heart surgery are:

1. Duly completed claim form
2. Photo Identity proof of the patient
3. Medical practitioner's prescription advising admission
4. Original bills with itemized break-up
5. Payment receipts
6. Discharge summary including complete medical history of the patient along with other details
7. Investigation/ Diagnostic test reports etc. supported by the prescription from attending medical practitioner

9. Sticker/Invoice of the Implants, wherever applicable
10. MLR (Medico Legal Report copy if carried out and FIR (First information report) if registered, where ever applicable
11. NEFT Details (to enable direct credit of claim amount in bank account) and cancelled cheque
12. Any other relevant document required by Company/TPA for assessment of the claim.
