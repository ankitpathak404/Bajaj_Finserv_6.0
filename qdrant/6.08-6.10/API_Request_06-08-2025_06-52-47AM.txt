RESPONSES GENERATED:
------------------------------
Q1: How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?
A1: Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the product of mass and velocity, which is now recognized as momentum. This is distinct from 'force', which is the cause of change in motion, as described by Newton's second law (F=ma).
--------------------------------------------------
Q2: According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?
A2: Newton's three laws of motion are: 1) Inertia, where objects maintain their state unless acted upon by an external force, explaining celestial bodies' continuous motion. 2) Force equals mass times acceleration, which calculates gravitational forces causing orbital acceleration. 3) Action and reaction, where mutual gravitational forces between bodies maintain their orbits.
--------------------------------------------------
Q3: How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?
A3: Newton derived Kepler's Second Law by applying his laws of motion and gravitation. He recognized that the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force for a planet's orbit. Since this force is central, it doesn't apply torque, thus conserving angular momentum. The conservation of angular momentum implies that the area swept by the planet's radius vector per unit time remains constant, which is Kepler's Second Law of equal areas in equal times.
--------------------------------------------------
Q4: How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?
A4: Newton demonstrated that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance by equating the centripetal force acting on the moon to the gravitational force, showing that the gravitational force decreases with the square of the distance between two masses.
--------------------------------------------------
Q5: What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?
A5: Newton argued that gravitational force must act universally because it consistently explains a wide range of phenomena, from the motion of planets to falling objects, and fits within a framework of uniform, law-governed universe.
--------------------------------------------------
Q6: How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?
A6: Newton explains that perturbations in planetary orbits are caused by the gravitational influence of other planets, as described by his law of universal gravitation.
--------------------------------------------------
Q7: What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?
A7: Newton used the method of fluxions and infinite series in Principia, which were precursors to calculus. He didn't use standard calculus notation because it hadn't been developed yet; instead, he relied on geometric methods and his own dot notation for derivatives.
--------------------------------------------------
Q8: How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?
A8: Newton explained orbital motion by identifying gravity as the centripetal force, which keeps celestial bodies in their orbits.
--------------------------------------------------
Q9: How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?
A9: Newton investigated motion in resisting media by studying the forces acting on bodies in fluids and air, proposing that resistance is proportional to the square of velocity and considering the influence of shape and medium type.
--------------------------------------------------
Q10: In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?
A10: Newton's absolute space and time are fixed, unchanging frameworks, whereas relative motion depends on the observer's frame of reference. This absolute framework supports Newton's laws by providing a consistent basis for measuring motion, force, and acceleration, ensuring their universal applicability.
--------------------------------------------------
Q11: Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?
A11: Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.
--------------------------------------------------
Q12: Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?
A12: Isaac Newton does not have any descendants as he never married and had no children. His lineage ends with him.
